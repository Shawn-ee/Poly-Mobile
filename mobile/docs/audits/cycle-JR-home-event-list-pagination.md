# Cycle JR - Home Event List Pagination

Status: Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope.

Scope:

- Home event list in server market-data mode.
- `/api/events` pagination contract with compact mobile markets.
- Home "Load more" backend page append behavior.
- No visual redesign, Search tab backend pagination, orderbook, chat, live stats product work, deposit, or withdraw changes.

## P0 Results

| Requirement | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend supports paged Home event list | Pass | `/api/events` accepts `limit` and `cursor`; proof at `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JR-home-event-list-pagination/cycle-JR-home-event-pagination.json`. |
| Backend returns the shape mobile needs | Pass | Response preserves `events[]` and adds `nextCursor` plus `page.limit/page.nextCursor/page.hasMore`; compact `markets[]` are still included with `includeMobileMarkets=1`. |
| Invalid cursor is rejected | Pass | Route validates cursor ids before querying the next page; focused route test covers cursor execution path. |
| Frontend sends backend pagination params | Pass | `PolyApi.listWorldCupEvents()` accepts `limit`, `cursor`, and `search`; mobile API test asserts query params. |
| Home Load more uses backend route in server mode | Pass | `App.tsx` stores `eventNextCursor`, calls the next backend page, and appends de-duplicated events; Home receives backend load-more controls only in server market-data mode. |
| Mock/local mode remains isolated | Pass | Home keeps local fixture slicing when no backend load-more handler is supplied. |
