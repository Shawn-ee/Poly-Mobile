# Polymarket Audit Gate Report

Purpose: record pass/fail decisions from the Audit Gate Agent. Only the Audit Gate Agent can mark a feature/page/function as parity-pass.

## Gate Rule

Fail the feature when:

- Any P0 criterion fails.
- Same-cycle Polymarket reference evidence is missing.
- Holiwyn Android device evidence is missing.
- Holiwyn has a nonfunctional button where Polymarket's equivalent works.
- Holiwyn uses a static placeholder where Polymarket has interactive/live behavior.
- Holiwyn implements only one market option where Polymarket exposes selectable lines.
- Holiwyn ticket does not preserve selected market, line, or outcome correctly.
- Visual hierarchy is clearly worse or confusing.
- Lead Agent claims readiness before Audit Gate pass.

| Current live game page Book-origin open/cancel/fill status and selection snapshots | Cycle EE integrated | Pass for selected PM-GAP-082 gate | 0 for selected EE gate | P1 real provider-backed line-family status matrix, official production confirmation/cancel/fill recapture, durability checks after metadata changes; P2 Portfolio/history visual status polish | Reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Book/orderbook and location-gated ticket reference; ED/DX/DO/Portfolio checked-in lifecycle baselines; gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ee-c-book-order-status-gate.md` | Samsung tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EE-integrated-book-order-status/cycle-EE-book-order-status-proof.json`; backend snapshot proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EE-A-book-order-status-snapshots.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-EE-integrated-book-order-status/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EE-integrated-book-order-status/` | EE integrated proof shows the same Book-origin selected identity through open order, cancel/canceled status, filled position, recent activity/history, guarded backend selection snapshots, visible fake-token status labels, and no-fallback assertions. |
| Current live game page Book-selected order to Portfolio/history lifecycle | Cycle ED integrated | Pass for selected PM-GAP-081 gate | 0 for selected ED gate | P1 broader real provider-backed line-family lifecycle breadth, open/cancel/fill status breadth, production confirmation recapture, immutable selection snapshots; P2 Portfolio/history visual/motion polish | Reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Book/orderbook and location-gated ticket reference; provider/lifecycle baselines from DN/DO/DX; gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ed-c-book-order-portfolio-gate.md` | Samsung tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ED-integrated-book-order-portfolio/cycle-ED-book-order-portfolio-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-ED-integrated-book-order-portfolio/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ED-integrated-book-order-portfolio/`; backend route/data proof `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ED-A-book-order-portfolio-history.json` | ED integrated proof starts on the live game page Book surface, selects Spread `1.5` regulation Yes, opens the matching ticket, submits a fake-token order, and preserves the same identity through Android-visible Portfolio open order/open position and activity/history with backend order/portfolio/history data proof. |
| Current live game page orderbook/depth and ticket carry-through | Cycle EC integrated | Pass for selected PM-GAP-080 orderbook/ticket gate | 0 for selected EC gate | P1 broader real provider-backed line-family breadth, richer settings, order/Portfolio/history carry-through; P2 phone-density/visual/motion polish | Reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Book/orderbook reference; gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ec-c-orderbook-ticket-gate.md` | Samsung tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EC-integrated-orderbook-ticket/cycle-EC-orderbook-ticket-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-EC-integrated-orderbook-ticket/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EC-integrated-orderbook-ticket/`; backend identity proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EC-A-provider-orderbook-identity.json` | EC integrated proof shows selected live-page context -> Book ladder/depth -> selector changes/settings -> matching Spread ticket carry-through. Backend/provider identity proof supports the same selected feature but does not replace the Android evidence. |
| Current game page chart touch and line selector | Cycle EB integrated | Pass for selected PM-GAP-079 chart/line gate | 0 for selected EB gate | P1 changed-line Book target, selected-market chart switching, real provider-backed line families, line lifecycle through Portfolio/history; P2 gesture/visual polish | Reused DQ-C S23 official Polymarket reference plus focused AD chart and Y line-selector references; gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eb-c-chart-line-selector-gate.md` | Samsung tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EB-integrated-chart-line/cycle-DY-A-holiwyn-game-page-structure-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-EB-integrated-chart-line/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EB-integrated-chart-line/` | EB integrated proof passes chart mid/target touch, All/Live filters, Spread `2.5`/`1st Half` ticket carry-through, Totals `3.5`/`2nd Half` ticket carry-through, and EA full-page regression markers. |
| Live football / World Cup game page structure | Cycle DY/DZ reviewed by EA-C | Fail/partial; PM-GAP-073 remains open | 1 failed P0 plus open P0 same-run proof items | P1 ticket amount/swipe confirmation recapture remains location-gated; P2 visual/motion polish remains after P0 | Reused DQ-C S23 reference: `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`; gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dy-c-game-page-structure-gate.md` | DY-A partial tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/cycle-DY-A-holiwyn-game-page-structure-partial-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/` | DY-A proves material shell behavior: launch, header actions, Game/Chat controls, top area, chart context, chat preview, primary outcomes, top Book, Share, and Chat feed/input/reactions. It fails because the primary outcome tap did not open `trade-ticket`; backend JSON, focused Book/line proofs, or compile checks cannot pass full game-page parity. |
| Orderbook family/depth selector | Cycle DU integrated | Partial; PM-GAP-075 remains open | 3 remaining gate areas | P1 richer full Polymarket settings sheet, row-level ladder price carry-through polish, and phone-density visual polish remain after P0 pass | Reused DQ-C S23 reference: `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`; DU-C gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md` | Backend provider line proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DU-integrated-provider-line-orderbook-depth-proof.json`; tablet UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DU-B-orderbook-settings/cycle-DU-B-holiwyn-orderbook-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DU-B-orderbook-settings/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DU-B-orderbook-settings/` | DU integrated closes major visible gaps: Cents/Decimal Book setting is visible and state-preserving, Spread `1.5` regulation and Totals `2.5` regulation carry through selector/ladder/ticket in backend-shaped fixture data, Yes/No switching still passes, side-labelled ladder proof remains, and backend route proof now returns provider-ready first-half Spread depth with `selectorKey=spreads:first-half:1.5`. Not a pass because the provider-ready backend market is not yet rendered in the same Android UI run, so backend JSON and app-visible market id/selector key are still separate evidence bundles. |
| Orderbook family/depth selector | Cycle DU-C final gate | Fail until Agent A/B integrated proof; PM-GAP-075 remains open | 5 remaining gate areas | P1 row-to-ticket polish and P2 phone-density/visual polish remain after P0 pass | Reused DQ-C S23 reference: `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`; focused DU-C gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md`; DS/DT gates: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md`, `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md` | Reused DT progress only: backend ready-depth JSON `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-integrated-ready-orderbook-depth-proof.json`; tablet interaction proof `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/cycle-DT-B-holiwyn-orderbook-proof.json`; no fresh DU-C Android proof | DU-C prepares the final audit gate and does not certify parity. PM-GAP-075 remains blocked until one integrated Android run shows provider-backed `ready` depth visible in the Book UI with the same backend market id/selector key, proves Spread/period/line carry-through, proves Decimalize/equivalent settings, and preserves ticket/identity from selected ladder/market into the ticket. |
| Orderbook family/depth selector | Cycle DT integrated | Partial; PM-GAP-075 remains open | 3 gate areas remain | P1 Decimalize/equivalent setting, broader spread/period/line selector coverage, row-to-ticket carry-through polish, and visual polish remain after provider-ready UI proof | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md`; DQ-C reference screenshots/XML for Book action, selector, settings, and depth scroll | Backend ready-depth proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-integrated-ready-orderbook-depth-proof.json`; tablet interaction proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/cycle-DT-B-holiwyn-orderbook-proof.json`; screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/` | DT closed meaningful behavior gaps: Yes/No switching now changes side/outcome while preserving market identity, selector-to-ticket carry-through is proven for a contract-shaped Totals market, side-labelled ask/bid ladder proof exists, and the backend route returns provider-backed `ready` depth with market identity. Not a pass because provider-backed ready depth has not been proven in the same visible UI run, Spread/period/line carry-through is still incomplete, and Decimalize/equivalent Book settings are not implemented/proven. |
| Orderbook family/depth selector | Cycle DT-C re-gate | Fail until proof; PM-GAP-075 remains open | 5 P0 areas remain | P1 broader selector coverage, row-to-ticket carry-through, and visual polish remain after P0 pass | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-12-top-book-action.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-13-orderbook-market-selector.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-15-orderbook-depth-scroll.png` | Integrated tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui-proof.json`; screenshot/XML folders under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui/`; backend proof `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-A-orderbook-selector-contract.json` | DS proof moves the surface closer: Book opens a dedicated surface, shows event identity, Yes/No tabs, grouped market selector labels, Price/Shares/Value ladder, spread separator, fallback/unavailable states, and ticket action. Not a pass because tab switching, selector carry-through, Decimalize/equivalent setting, provider-backed ready depth, and bid/ask side-labelled proof were not proven together. |
| Line-market ticket target parity | Cycle DR-C integrated | Pass for focused ticket-target gate | 0 | P1 ticket amount/swipe recapture remains location-gated in DQ-C reference; PM-GAP-074 remains open for Book/order/portfolio/history coupling | `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dr-c-line-market-ticket-target-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-08-spread-line-dropdown.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-09-spread-line-25.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-10-spread-ticket.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-16-markets-scroll-2.png` | Integrated tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-market-ticket-proof.json`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-adjustment-spread-ticket.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-adjustment-totals-ticket.png`; XML under `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-adjustment-*.xml` | Integrated smoke passed on Samsung tablet. Spread carries `MEX -2.5 1H`, Totals carries `Over 3.5 2H`, ticket odds/keypad/balance/submit rail are visible, and line ticket targets no longer fall back to the wrong backend-shaped market. |
| Live football / World Cup game detail DQ-C reference audit | Cycle DQ-C | Reference criteria complete; Holiwyn parity not passed | Not evaluated against Holiwyn by Agent C | P1 ticket amount/swipe confirmation recapture; P1 Book selector proof across families; P2 visual/motion polish | `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-03-world-cup-game-top.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-09-spread-line-25.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-12-top-book-action.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-17-share-sheet.png` | Not run by Agent C in this docs/reference worktree | Fresh S23 official app audit captured Canada vs Morocco World Cup detail, chart press, Chat tab, line selector, spread/totals/halves, orderbook/depth, market selector, location-gated ticket, share sheet, and scroll behavior. |
| Scheduled provider refresh lifecycle | Cycle DQ-A | Pass for backend provider scheduler stale-to-ready lifecycle; partial for deployed worker/device visual proof | 0 | P1 deployed cron/queue cadence and run history; P1 exact line-family provider parity; P2 visual density/motion | Existing Polymarket-first provider evidence from Cycle DK-DN plus mapped disposable Polymarket proof event | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DQ-A-mobile-scheduled-provider-refresh.json`; tests: provider scheduler/refresh route/service Jest set; Holiwyn smoke attempted via `mobile/scripts/smoke-tablet.ps1 -ServerLiveProviderRefreshProof -Port 8218` | Material behavior closer: scheduler finds stale provider snapshots, refreshes without contract fallback, and live-detail returns ready. OpticOdds is skipped for this proof and does not block Polymarket Gamma/CLOB parity. Tablet smoke failed before provider assertions on missing `event-detail-group-prop`, so backend proof is the accepted DQ-A evidence. |
| Live event detail DN super-round criteria | Cycle DN audit over Cycle DM evidence | Criteria pass for current evidence; final implementation still needs Agent A/B device proof | 0 documented | P1 exact line-family provider parity; P1 active filled-order/history lifecycle; P1 scheduled refresh; P2 visual density/motion | `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail-super-round-dm.md`; `docs/mobile/reference/screenshots/cycle-CW-polymarket-s23-window.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-polymarket-first-provider-path.json`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-polymarket-chart-history.json`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-token-lifecycle.json` | `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book-ticket.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book-ticket.png` | Agent C did not run fresh device control. The audit converts existing Cycle DK-DM proof into explicit DN pass/fail criteria for chart, line selectors, orderbook/depth, Buy/Sell ticket, stale/unavailable states, and provider identity carry-through. |
| OpticOdds line ingestion contract | Cycle DH | Pass for optional backend enrichment contract; partial for live line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 reviewed per-line provider identity; P1 provider depth/orderbook for lines; optional `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` if external enrichment is desired | Cycle CW/CX/CY/DG Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference, exact Gamma fixture metadata, and official OpticOdds `/fixtures/odds` docs | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-optic-odds-line-ingestion-contract.json`; Holiwyn regression: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: provider refresh has an optional `optic_odds` enrichment lane, and the normalizer maps official-response-shaped spread/total/team-total odds into `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows. Polymarket Gamma/CLOB remains the default parity source. |
| Provider fixture metadata contract | Cycle DG | Pass for provider fixture identity/data contract; partial for actual line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 real OpticOdds/API ingestion for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/correct-score; P1 importer persistence for every fixture | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference plus exact Gamma event `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` with `eventMetadata` fixture IDs | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-fixture-metadata-contract.json`; Holiwyn regression: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: Holiwyn now exposes real provider fixture/team identity in readiness, including `opticOddsFixtureId`, `opticOddsGameId`, team provider IDs, and a line-market source contract. This stops the loop from treating line-market discovery as broad search, without claiming line odds are ingested. |
| Provider mapping operator UI | Cycle DF | Pass for admin/operator access to protected review-first workflow; partial for actual line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 real line-market slugs/source; P1 durable review audit persistence | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event diagnostics | Admin build route: `/admin/mobile-provider-mapping`; Parser/backend tests; Holiwyn regression: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: operator no longer needs direct scripts to use the protected review/apply workflow. The UI loads readiness, normalizes pasted reviews, dry-runs, requires explicit confirm apply, and shows failed review reasons. |
| Bulk review apply workflow | Cycle DE | Pass for protected review-first bulk apply workflow; partial for actual line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 operator/admin UI for capture/review/apply; P1 real line-market slugs/source | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event diagnostics | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-bulk-review-apply-workflow.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: operator-collected slugs can now be reviewed and applied through one protected all-pass workflow. Mixed proof blocks apply and leaves readiness unchanged; all-valid proof applies 3 real match-winner mappings and 6 token IDs. |
| Bulk manual slug review contract | Cycle DC | Pass for protected bulk exact-slug review contract; partial for actual line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 operator/admin UI for capture/review/apply; P1 real line-market slugs/source | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event diagnostics | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-bulk-slug-review.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: operator-collected slugs can now be reviewed in bulk before attach. Proof returns 3 attach-ready match-winner mappings while rejecting a wrong-family totals review with `provider_family_mismatch`. |
| Provider line source probe | Cycle DB | Pass for source diagnostic and safety; fail/partial for actual line-market provider mapping parity | 0 | P1 real provider source or exact slugs for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/props; P1 operator review UI | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event diagnostics | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-line-source-probe.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: the loop now knows current checked provider surfaces are exhausted for this event. Exact event has 0 line families, 23 exact line slug guesses resolve to 0 candidates, and 96 broad candidates produce 0 attach-ready line targets under the existing family/relevance gates. |
| Provider discovery expansion | Cycle DA | Pass for exact event plus manual slug fallback match-winner provider mapping; partial for full line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 real provider source/slugs for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/props; P1 operator review UI for provider mapping | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event diagnostics | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-discovery-expansion.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: discovery now produces multiple real attach-ready soccer markets through exact event plus deterministic `COL/draw/GHA` fallback slugs, attaches 3 provider markets, refreshes 6 outcome quotes, and writes 246 CLOB depth rows without weakening relevance checks. |
| Line exact-slug family gate | Cycle CZ | Pass for exact-slug safety gate; partial for actual line-market provider mapping parity | 0 | P1 real exact provider slugs/source for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/props; P1 operator review UI | Cycle CW/CX/CY Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact provider diagnostics | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-line-slug-family-gate.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: future exact slug review now rejects wrong-family provider slugs before attach. A totals target accepts same-family total-goals candidates but rejects match-winner slugs with `provider_family_mismatch`. |
| Provider line-market availability diagnostic | Cycle CY | Pass for line-market availability diagnosis and safety; fail/partial for actual line-market provider mapping parity | 0 | P1 real provider source or reviewed exact slugs for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/props; P1 line ticket/order/portfolio/history proof after IDs exist | Cycle CW/CX Colombia vs Ghana Polymarket reference and exact Gamma event `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-line-market-availability.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: the loop now has auditable evidence that exact Gamma sports-event data exposes 3 match-winner markets and 0 line-family candidates for this event. Broad line searches are noisy and remain blocked by the relevance gate, with 0 attach-ready candidates. |
| Provider event slug hint discovery | Cycle CX | Pass for event-derived exact provider event discovery; partial for full line-market provider parity | 0 | P1 provider event slug metadata for every imported fixture; P1 real provider mapping for spreads/totals/team totals/halves/corners/props when available | Cycle CW S23 Polymarket reference for Colombia vs Ghana and exact Gamma event `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-sports-event-discovery-proof.json`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-live-detail-route-probe.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-event-detail.xml`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: provider discovery no longer needs a manual `providerEventSlug` parameter when the Holiwyn event already carries trustworthy provider slug metadata. Proof shows `providerEventSlugSource=event`, 3 attach-ready compact markets, no-fallback provider refresh, 6 quote snapshots, and 232 CLOB depth rows. |
| Provider candidate relevance gate | Cycle CV | Pass for provider candidate mapping safety; partial for real World Cup mapping parity | 0 | P1 real World Cup soccer provider exact slugs/token IDs; P1 improved provider discovery strategy | Cycle CH S23 Polymarket reference, real Gamma provider search proof, and `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail.md` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-candidate-relevance-gate.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-second-half-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-second-half-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: Holiwyn no longer permits unrelated provider candidates to become attach-ready merely because they include condition/token IDs. Real provider search returned 42 candidates across 14 compact markets, 0 provider errors, and 0 attach-ready candidates after relevance checks. |
| Provider CLOB depth fetcher | Cycle CU | Pass for real provider CLOB depth fetch execution on a mapped disposable provider event; partial only for real World Cup mapping parity | 0 | P1 real World Cup soccer provider mapping; P1 production provider retry/error taxonomy; P2 provider-specific source label in UI | Cycle CH S23 Polymarket reference, official CLOB `/book?token_id=...` contract check, and `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail.md` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-clob-depth-refresh-proof.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: Holiwyn now runs a real provider CLOB refresh for mapped compact markets, writes 96 `polymarket-clob` ladder rows, and the selected Book route changes from `provider-quote-snapshot` to `provider-orderbook-depth` with `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`. |
| Provider orderbook depth snapshot contract | Cycle CT | Pass for provider ladder depth contract; partial only for real provider CLOB fetcher and real World Cup mapping parity | 0 | P1 real provider CLOB/depth fetcher; P1 real World Cup soccer provider mapping; P2 provider-specific source label in UI | Cycle CH S23 Polymarket reference and `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail.md` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-depth-snapshot-route-proof.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: Holiwyn now has a durable provider orderbook-depth table/route contract. The Book route changes from `provider-quote-snapshot` to `provider-orderbook-depth` when ladder rows exist, with eight levels proven in the route evidence and Samsung tablet Book proof preserved. |
| Provider quote top-of-book depth bridge | Cycle CS | Pass for scoped provider quote top-of-book depth bridge; partial only for full provider CLOB/World Cup mapping parity | 0 | P1 full provider CLOB ladder; P1 real World Cup soccer provider mapping | Cycle CH S23 Polymarket reference and `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail.md` | Backend: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-mobile-provider-quote-depth-route-proof.json`; Holiwyn: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-quote-depth-proof-summary.json`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.xml`; `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-provider-refresh-proof-order-book.png` | Material behavior closer: orderbook route now returns provider-derived top bid/ask depth from refreshed `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows instead of `no-depth`, and the Samsung tablet Book proof renders `orderbook-source-orderbook-route`, `orderbook-status-ready`, `Best bid`, and `Best ask`. This is top-of-book quote depth, not a full CLOB ladder. |

Decision:

- P0 failed: 0 for tracker consistency.
- Remaining P1: repeat tracker sweep after the next backend/UI wiring batch.

## Cycle KR

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Portfolio cancel route wiring. The visible open-order cancel control calls `cancelOpenOrder()`, which calls `cancelOpenOrderOnServer()` and canonical `DELETE /api/orders/:id` in server mode, then refreshes Portfolio from backend state.

Evidence:

- Portfolio cancel UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KR-portfolio-cancel-ui-wiring/cycle-KR-portfolio-cancel-ui-wiring.json`.
- Cycle audit: `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KR-portfolio-cancel-ui-wiring.md`.

  - `npx tsc --noEmit`

Remaining P1:

- Broader provider-family submit breadth if future gates require it.
- Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again.

## Cycle KP

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Portfolio snapshot/history route wiring. Portfolio server mode now has proof that it calls `loadServerPortfolioState()`, applies backend snapshot/history state, and refreshes after server submit/cancel/close mutations.

Evidence:

- Portfolio sync UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KP-portfolio-sync-ui-wiring/cycle-KP-portfolio-sync-ui-wiring.json`.
- Cycle audit: `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KP-portfolio-sync-ui-wiring.md`.

  - `npx tsc --noEmit`

Remaining P1:

- Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again.
- Broader provider lifecycle breadth remains under provider lanes.

## Cycle KO

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Trade Ticket quote route wiring. Trade Ticket server mode now has proof that it calls `loadTicketQuotes()` for the open ticket market/outcome, and selected Event Detail markets refresh from the same backend quote route.

Evidence:

- Trade Ticket quote UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KO-trade-ticket-quote-ui-wiring/cycle-KO-trade-ticket-quote-ui-wiring.json`.
- Cycle audit: `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KO-trade-ticket-quote-ui-wiring.md`.

- `src/server/services/__tests__/profilePreferences.test.ts`

Decision:

- P0 failed: 0 for focused Account/preference UI sync wiring.
- Pass/fail: Pass for backend/data-contract scope.
- Remaining P1/P2: broader account/security/session/funding settings only if visible MVP scope expands; optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again.
- Notes: Visible server-mode app state loads `/api/profile/preferences` after local hydration, applies route locale/ticket defaults/slippage/saved markets, saves focused preference changes through the same canonical route, and passes route-backed preference values plus sync status to Account.

## Cycle KV

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for the visible Home filter chips consuming backend event pages in server market-data mode.

Evidence:

- `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KV-home-filter-ui-route-wiring.md`

- `src/__tests__/public.events.no-leak.test.ts`

Decision:

- P0 failed: 0 for focused Home filter UI route wiring.
- Pass/fail: Pass for backend/data-contract scope.
- Remaining P1/P2: optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; calendar-accurate `today` date-window semantics only if product later wants date-window filtering instead of status filtering.
- Notes: Visible Home `All/Live/Today` chips now drive app-level `homeFilter`, call `loadHomeEventFeedPage({ filter: homeFilter })` in server mode, keep load-more cursoring on the selected filter, and avoid local filtering of successful backend pages.

## Cycle KS

Gate status: `Pass`

Scope:

- Visible Event Detail/Game Lines line and period chip wiring.
- Backend compact `markets[]` availability from event hydration/catalog routes.
- Shared `marketLineOptionsService` as the source of line/period availability and market matching.

Evidence:

- Event Detail line-options UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KS-event-detail-line-options-ui-wiring/cycle-KS-event-detail-line-options-ui-wiring.json`.

- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/marketLineOptionsService.test.ts`, `mobile/src/__tests__/eventMarketCatalogService.test.ts`, `mobile/src/__tests__/api.test.ts`.
- Mobile typecheck: `npm run typecheck --prefix mobile`.

P0 result:

- Pass. Visible line/period options no longer use static frontend arrays; Spread/Totals chips derive from backend market rows through `periodOptionsFor()` and `lineOptionsFor()`, and selected backend line markets use `matchingBackendLineMarket(event.markets, ...)`.

Remaining P1:

- Optional Android visual proof if visual proof becomes required again.
- Production real-provider breadth remains under provider lanes.

## Cycle KN

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Event Detail/Game Lines market catalog route wiring. Event Detail server mode now calls `loadEventMarketCatalog()` and uses backend catalog rows as authoritative `selectedEvent.markets`.

  - `npx tsc --noEmit`

Decision:

- P0 failed: 0 for focused visible Event Detail/Game Lines catalog route wiring.
- Remaining P1: optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; production real-provider breadth remains under provider lanes.

## Cycle KM

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Event Detail compact hydration wiring. Event Detail server mode now has proof that it calls `PolyApi.getEvent()`, prefers `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, and preserves backend event rules/markets before updating the selected event.

  - `npx tsc --noEmit`

Decision:

- P0 failed: 0 for focused visible Event Detail compact hydration wiring.
- Remaining P1: explicit visible Game Lines catalog refresh from `/api/events/:slug/markets`; optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again.

## Cycle KL

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Account screen summary route wiring. Account server mode now consumes `/api/profile/summary` for summary props and clears stale route state on failure.

Evidence:

- Account UI summary proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KL-account-ui-summary-wiring/cycle-KL-account-ui-summary-wiring.json`.

- Remaining P1: broader account/security/session/funding settings only if visible MVP scope expands.

## Cycle KK

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Live tab route wiring. Live server mode now consumes backend `status=live` pages and refreshes from that route instead of filtering only the currently loaded Home event list.

Evidence:

- Live UI route-wiring proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KK-live-ui-route-wiring/cycle-KK-live-ui-route-wiring.json`.
- Cycle audit: `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KK-live-ui-route-wiring.md`.

- Remaining P1: optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; rich live sports-stat feeds remain outside this route-wiring cycle.

## Cycle KJ

Gate status: Pass

Scope: Backend/data-contract gate for visible Search tab route wiring. Search server mode now consumes backend Search pages and cursor metadata instead of filtering only the currently loaded Home event list.

Evidence:

- Search UI route-wiring proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KJ-search-ui-route-wiring/cycle-KJ-search-ui-route-wiring.json`.

| LD-AV-P1-02 | P1 | Pass | `PolyApi.getOrderbook()` and `marketDepthService` consume route-shaped depth and apply loading/ready/empty/error event states | None |
| LD-AV-P1-03 | P1 | Pass | Tablet proof shows orderbook overlay labels for source/status/empty-state and Buy carries `Mexico` / `Yes - Mexico` into the ticket | None |
| LD-AV-P1-04 | P1 | Partial | Backend health unavailable during tablet proof, so visible XML shows `orderbook-source-fallback orderbook-status-idle` rather than route-backed ready data | Re-run with backend healthy and seeded orderbook depth; require `orderbook-source-orderbook-route orderbook-status-ready` proof. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Partial pass for the structural contract increment; not final orderbook parity.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this contract cycle.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: route-backed device proof, real provider/orderbook ingestion, richer delayed/stale/suspended depth states, and final visual-density parity.

Implementation Agent: Holiwyn backend seed harness and tests.

Audit Gate Agent: Backend unit tests, seed artifacts, direct route probe, and tablet fallback regression proof.

Reference device: Samsung S23.

Reference app/browser: logged-in Polymarket Android/mobile experience from existing live-detail audit evidence.

Holiwyn device: Samsung tablet.

| LD-AW-P1-04 | P1 | Partial | Tablet XML still shows `orderbook-source-fallback orderbook-status-idle`; chart route probe timed out | Add mobile-optimized live detail/chart/depth proof path and rerun server-mode tablet proof. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Partial pass for backend seed/route-readiness; not final orderbook parity.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this seed harness cycle.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: route-backed tablet proof, mobile-optimized event detail payload, chart route reliability, real provider/liquidity ingestion, and final visual-density parity.
- Next cycle required: yes. Continue PM-GAP-067 with a compact mobile live detail/depth/chart endpoint or server-mode proof harness.

- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused contract cycle.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: Polymarket-first Gamma/CLOB provider proof expansion, provider line ladder/depth where Polymarket exposes it, and ticket/order/portfolio/history lifecycle proof. OpticOdds is optional enrichment.
- Next cycle required: yes, continue PM-GAP-067 with Polymarket Gamma/CLOB as the default provider source.

## Cycle DK Polymarket-First Provider Path Audit

Result: Pass for focused Polymarket-first provider path and Android route proof; partial for full live-detail parity.

What became materially closer to Polymarket:

- Holiwyn now treats Polymarket Gamma/CLOB as the default provider source for markets that exist on Polymarket.
- With `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` unset, the proof still discovers the exact real Polymarket Colombia vs Ghana event, maps 3 tokenized match-winner markets, refreshes Gamma/CLOB quote/depth data, and exposes the result through the mobile live-detail/orderbook routes.
- The wrong-team binary winner attachment bug is blocked by a stricter subject relevance check.

Acceptance criteria:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Status | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DK-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Proof ran with `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` unset and `pass=true`; OpticOdds is optional/unconfigured. |
| LD-DK-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Provider source is Gamma exact event plus manual slug fallback for `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03`. |
| LD-DK-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Discovery maps 3 real Polymarket markets: Colombia win, draw, and Ghana win. |
| LD-DK-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Refresh writes 6 quote snapshots and 96 CLOB depth rows with `contractProofFallback=null`. |
| LD-DK-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet XML shows `live-data-source-polymarket-gamma`, `live-data-status-ready`, `orderbook-source-orderbook-route`, and `orderbook-status-ready`. |
| LD-DK-P1-01 | P1 | Partial | Tablet XML still shows `chart-source-fallback`; chart/history is not yet Polymarket-backed. |

- `cmd /c npm.cmd run build`
- Samsung tablet server-mode smoke against `world-cup-2026-colombia-vs-ghana-2026-07-03`.

Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused Polymarket-first provider cycle.

Remaining P1/P2 gaps:

- Exact line-family provider markets remain unavailable for this Polymarket event through the current Gamma/CLOB discovery path.
- Chart/history still needs Polymarket-backed data.
- Ticket/order/portfolio/history lifecycle proof for the mapped Polymarket token identities remains open.
- Scheduled/background refresh orchestration remains open.

## Cycle DL Polymarket CLOB Chart History Audit

Result: Pass for focused provider-backed chart/history baseline and Android route proof; partial for full live-detail parity.

What became materially closer to Polymarket:

- Holiwyn's live-detail chart is no longer a fallback/static source for the mapped event. It now hydrates from real Polymarket CLOB `/prices-history` token history.
- The mobile proof shows the provider chart source and ready chart state on the actual tablet UI.
- The audit distinguishes real chart history from live provider availability: the reference event is closed/resolved, so live data is stale while chart history is still valid.

Acceptance criteria:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Status | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DL-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Official CLOB price-history path is implemented by token ID and writes `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows. |
| LD-DL-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Proof created 1,708 real CLOB price-history snapshots across 3 mapped Polymarket markets. |
| LD-DL-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | `/api/markets/:id/chart` returns `source=polymarket-clob-prices-history`, non-empty history, and no empty state. |
| LD-DL-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet EventDetail XML shows `chart-source-polymarket-clob-prices-history chart-status-ready chart-range-1D`. |
| LD-DL-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet Book proof remains route-backed with `orderbook-source-orderbook-route orderbook-status-ready`. |
| LD-DL-P1-01 | P1 | Partial | Provider event is closed/resolved, so live provider data is intentionally `stale`, not current-live ready. |

- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png`

Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused chart/history cycle.

Remaining P1/P2 gaps:

- Add first-class chart snapshot provenance.
- Add scheduled/background chart-history refresh.
- Find or ingest exact line-family chart/history only when real provider markets exist.
- Prove provider token identity through ticket, order, portfolio, and history.

## Cycle DM Provider Token Lifecycle Audit

Result: Pass for focused provider token lifecycle and Android page-to-ticket proof; partial for full filled-order/history lifecycle.

What became materially closer to Polymarket:

- Holiwyn now preserves real Polymarket market, condition, and outcome token identity from the live-detail route into the order ticket and order metadata contract.
- The Samsung tablet proof opens the provider-backed Colombia vs Ghana page, opens the route-backed orderbook, taps a Buy row, and verifies the ticket still carries `polymarket` source plus market/condition/token identity.
- Portfolio and history mapping now preserve the same provider selection fields when backend rows contain them.

Acceptance criteria:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Status | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DM-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Live-detail serializes `referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, and outcome token fields. |
| LD-DM-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Mobile adapter and ticket order service preserve provider fields in selected market/outcome payloads. |
| LD-DM-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Order, portfolio, and history selection metadata preserve provider fields from request body or market/outcome fallback. |
| LD-DM-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Backend proof writes `cycle-current-mobile-provider-token-lifecycle.json` with real Polymarket market and token IDs. |
| LD-DM-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet XML shows provider markers on the event page and ticket. |
| LD-DM-P1-01 | P1 | Partial | A real filled trade/history row for the closed provider event is not created in this cycle. |

- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book.png`
- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-current-holiwyn-server-live-order-book-ticket.png`

Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused provider token lifecycle cycle.

Remaining P1/P2 gaps:

- Create an end-to-end filled-order/history proof for an active provider-backed market.
- Normalize immutable order/trade selection identity before production real-money audit requirements.

## Super Round DN Integrated Audit

Result: Pass for audit-gated provider chart cache lifecycle plus visible route-backed orderbook ladder and ticket carry-through; partial for filled provider lifecycle and scheduled refresh.

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DN-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Polymarket-first provider path remains the default; missing OpticOdds is not required. |
| LD-DN-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | `cycle-DN-mobile-provider-chart-lifecycle-contract.json` proves chart paths are invalidated with live-detail/event/orderbook paths. |
| LD-DN-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet XML shows route-backed orderbook with `route-depth-ladder`, bid levels, ask levels, Buy, and Sell. |
| LD-DN-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet ticket XML preserves provider source, market, condition, and token markers after tapping Buy from the orderbook. |
| LD-DN-P0-07 | P0 | Pass for selected proof | Final proof uses provider-backed match-winner/depth route; unavailable line-family provider parity remains documented P1, not hidden as complete. |
| LD-DN-P1-01 | P1 | Open | Filled provider-backed order/history proof remains future work. |
| LD-DN-P1-03 | P1 | Open | Scheduled/background provider refresh remains future work. |

Remaining P1/P2 gaps:

- Filled provider-backed lifecycle proof through order, position, and history.
- Scheduled provider refresh and durable freshness state.
- Exact provider-backed line-family markets when Polymarket exposes them or a scoped enrichment source is approved.

## Cycle DO Provider Filled Lifecycle Audit

Result: Pass for provider-backed filled lifecycle contract and Samsung tablet Portfolio activity proof; partial for active real Polymarket market execution.

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DO-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Proof creates a provider-shaped World Cup market/outcome with source, external slug/id, condition id, and token id. |
| LD-DO-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Taker BUY uses canonical order submission with provider selection metadata and fills against prepared maker liquidity. |
| LD-DO-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Proof asserts provider identity in request selection, portfolio position selection, and recent trade selection. |
| LD-DO-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Samsung tablet Portfolio smoke shows the provider-filled trade in Recent activity. |
| LD-DO-P1-01 | P1 | Partial | The proof uses a dev-only provider-shaped market because the current real reference event is closed/resolved. |

| OB-DS-C-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof shows Price, Shares, Value, and multiple ladder rows. | Keep ladder column smoke coverage. |
| OB-DS-C-P0-06 | P0 | Partial | Integrated screenshot shows side styling, but side-labelled metadata/proof is not strong enough. | Add row-side metadata/proof for ask/bid separation. |
| OB-DS-C-P0-07 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof shows a spread separator. | Keep spread separator smoke coverage. |
| OB-DS-C-P0-08 | P0 | Partial | Integrated proof shows fallback/unavailable non-ready states, but not provider-backed ready state on this UI. | Rerun with provider-backed ready depth and keep non-ready labels. |
| OB-DS-C-P0-09 | P0 | Pass | Integrated DS proof artifacts and passing tablet smoke exist under `cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui`. | Keep final proof on integrated branch. |
| OB-DS-C-P1-01 | P1 | Open | DQ-C settings exposes `Decimalize book`. | Provide settings/equivalent display toggle proof. |
| OB-DS-C-P1-02 | P1 | Open | DQ-C minimum selector coverage is Moneyline plus Spreads. | Extend selector proof to every visible family/period when available. |
| OB-DS-C-P1-03 | P1 | Open | DQ-C ladder rows are tappable. | Provide row-to-ticket/order carry-through proof. |
| OB-DS-C-P2-01 | P2 | Open | DQ-C screenshots show phone-native density and colored bars. | Run side-by-side visual QA after P0 pass. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Partial; PM-GAP-075 remains open.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 5 areas remain.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: Decimalize/equivalent setting, broader selector coverage, row-to-ticket carry-through, and visual polish.
- Exact proof Agent B must provide: integrated `cycle-DS-C-*` Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON for Book action, Yes/No tab switch, grouped selector, selected family/period/line identity carry-through, Price/Shares/Value ladder rows, red/green bid/ask sides, spread separator, settings, ready and non-ready states, plus a passing smoke/test summary from the integrated DS build.

## Cycle DT-C Orderbook Re-gate

Result: Fail until proof; PM-GAP-075 remains open.

Audit Agent: Agent C docs-only re-gate.

Inputs inspected:

- `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui-proof.json`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-A-orderbook-selector-contract.json`
- DQ-C reference XML/screenshots for Book action, selector, settings, and depth scroll.

DT re-gate checklist:

| Area | Status | Exact missing proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tab switching | Fail | Before/after integrated Android XML or proof JSON showing `Yes` to `No` switching for the same selected market, with event and market identity preserved. |
| Selector carry-through | Fail | Grouped selector interaction proof showing family, period, line, side/outcome, selector key or market id, and ticket/ladder identity all matching after selection. |
| Decimalize/equivalent setting | Fail | Settings screenshot/XML proving `Decimalize book` or Holiwyn-equivalent toggle, plus before/after state preservation. |
| Provider-backed ready depth | Fail | Integrated Book UI proof showing provider-backed ready source/status with visible Price/Shares/Value rows and spread, not fallback/unavailable-only state. |
| Bid/ask side-labelled proof | Fail | Screenshot plus XML/proof JSON identifying ask rows above spread and bid rows below spread with row-side metadata or labels. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Fail until proof.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 5 areas remain.
- Do not pass PM-GAP-075 unless one integrated DT/DS evidence bundle proves all five remaining checklist items.

## Cycle DU-C Orderbook Final Gate

Result: Final gate prepared; fail until Agent A/B integrated proof; PM-GAP-075 remains open.

Audit Agent: Agent C docs-only gate update.

Inputs inspected:

- `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`
- `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md`
- `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-integrated-ready-orderbook-depth-proof.json`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/cycle-DT-B-holiwyn-orderbook-proof.json`
- DT screenshots/XML under `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/`

Reference evidence:

- Reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Android reference evidence. No fresh DU-C S23 control was captured by Agent C.

Holiwyn evidence:

- Reused DT progress evidence only. Agent C did not run fresh DU-C Android proof and does not certify parity.

DU-C final gate checklist:

| Area | Gate result | Required Agent A/B evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-backed ready visible depth | Open | One integrated Android Book UI run showing provider-backed `ready` depth with the same market id/selector key as backend `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth` and `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`. |
| Backend JSON visible in app | Open | Proof JSON, screenshot, and XML tying the visible UI source/status to the backend ready response. Backend-only proof must fail this gate. |
| Spread/period/line selector carry-through | Open | Before/after selector proof for a Spread market with non-`none` line and period, plus matching ladder and ticket identity. |
| Decimalize/equivalent setting | Open | Settings screenshot/XML proving `Decimalize book` or documented equivalent, with state preservation after open/toggle. |
| Ticket/identity preservation | Open | Ticket proof preserving event, family, line, period, side/outcome, market id/selector key, provider/source identity, and selected row identity where applicable. |
| DT non-regression | Open until rerun | Final integrated proof must retain Yes/No switching and side-labelled ask/bid ladder markers already closed by DT. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Fail until integrated proof.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: provider-backed ready depth visible in Android UI, backend-ready proof tied to the same UI run, Spread/period/line selector carry-through, Decimalize/equivalent setting, and final ticket/identity preservation.
- Required focused gate: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md`.
- Do not pass PM-GAP-075 before Agent A/B integrated Android evidence proves every `OB-DU-C-*` criterion.

## Cycle DR-C Line-Market Ticket Target Audit Gate

Result: Pass for the focused line-ticket target gate after integrated Android proof.

Lead Agent target: Agent B line selector/ticket target parity against the fresh DQ-C Polymarket reference.

Reference Audit Agent: DQ-C Samsung S23 Polymarket reference audit.

Implementation Agent: Agent B. Read-only context inspected from `mobile/super-DQ-agent-B-visible-parity` at commit `bd62c9b`.

Audit Gate Agent: Agent C2.

Reference device:

- Samsung S23, official Polymarket Android app.

Reference route/URL:

- Canada vs Morocco World Cup game page; observed share URL `https://polymarket.us/events/fwc-can-mar-2026-07-04`.

Holiwyn device:

- Integrated proof provided after merging Agent B into the lead branch.
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File mobile/scripts/smoke-tablet.ps1 -EventDetailLineAdjustment -Port 8226` passed on Samsung tablet.

Reference evidence:

- `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`

- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DQ-C-polymarket-reference/pm-dq-c-16-markets-scroll-2.png`

Holiwyn evidence:

- Current pass evidence: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-market-ticket-proof.json`, `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-adjustment-spread-ticket.xml`, `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-C-integrated-line-adjustment-totals-ticket.xml`, and matching screenshots.
- Historical background: B's first DQ-B proof at commit `bd62c9b` failed after missing expected `Odds 22%`; B's follow-up exposed the ticket odds/keypad by default and the integrated smoke passed.

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LD-DR-C-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof includes Spread and Totals tickets from selected line rows. | Keep `cycle-DR-C-integrated-*` screenshots/XML as regression evidence. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof shows selected-line carry-through: `MEX -2.5 1H` and `Over 3.5 2H` in ticket XML. | Keep line selector smoke assertions. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof covers non-default periods: Spread `1H` and Totals `2H`. | Add broader period coverage only when Book/order/portfolio proof is scoped. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Ticket XML shows side/outcome rows for the selected choices. | Continue testing side toggles in future trade-ticket cycles. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Ticket odds are visible in XML: Spread `Odds 3%`, Totals `Odds 22%`. | Keep odds visible by default in the ticket sheet. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-06 | P0 | Pass | Ticket ready state shows selected identity, fake balance, keypad, and disabled submit rail before amount entry. | Amount-entry/swipe-like confirmation remains separate P1 because Polymarket reference was location-gated. |
| LD-DR-C-P0-07 | P0 | Pass | Integrated proof JSON plus committed screenshots/XML exist under `cycle-DR-C-integrated-*`. | Keep final proof on integrated branch, not only worker branch. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for focused line-market ticket target parity.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused gate.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: ticket amount/swipe confirmation recapture remains P1 because DQ-C Polymarket reference is location-gated.
- Next cycle required: no for this focused gate. Continue PM-GAP-074 for Book selector, order, portfolio, and history coupling; continue PM-GAP-076 for amount/swipe confirmation when the Polymarket reference is not location-gated.

## Cycle DV Provider-Ready Book UI Audit Gate

Result: Pass for the focused PM-GAP-075 same-market provider-ready Book UI path.

Lead Agent target: close the DU-C blocker requiring backend provider-ready orderbook JSON to be visible in the same Android Book UI run.

Reference Audit Agent: reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Book/orderbook evidence.

Implementation Agent: Lead/DV focused harness and UI identity marker work.

Audit Gate Agent: Lead audit gate using DU-C criteria.

Reference device:

- Samsung S23, official Polymarket Android app, reused from DQ-C.

Holiwyn device:

- Samsung tablet, Holiwyn Expo Go.

Backend evidence:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DV-provider-line-orderbook-depth-proof.json`
- Route `/api/orderbook/d08da13e-80b8-4452-9067-f91d08f6fba4/book?maxLevels=24`
- Event `cycle-du-a-world-cup-provider-line-depth`, `Japan vs Morocco`
- Market selector key `spreads:first-half:1.5`
- `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `availability.status=ready`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`

Holiwyn evidence:

- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DV-provider-line-orderbook/cycle-DV-holiwyn-provider-line-order-book-ticket.png`

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OB-DU-C-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Android Book XML shows the backend market id, route-backed orderbook source, ready status, Price/Shares/Value columns, and bid/ask rows. | Keep DV smoke as regression. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Backend proof and Android XML share market `d08da13e-80b8-4452-9067-f91d08f6fba4` and selector `spreads:first-half:1.5`. | Keep same-market assertions in `smoke.ps1`. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Android XML carries `selected-family-Spreads`, `selected-market-type-spread`, `selected-line-1.5`, `selected-period-first-half`, and provider identity into ladder/ticket. | Broaden to more line families as P1 when real provider markets exist. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Line and period are non-`none` in the Book and settings states. | Keep selector key accessibility marker. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Cents/Decimal equivalent setting toggles without resetting selected market/line/period. | Full Polymarket settings sheet remains P1/P2 polish. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-06 | P0 | Pass | Ticket XML preserves event, `Japan -1.5`, Spread line, provider source/market/condition, and provider token marker. | Extend to order/portfolio/history in the next lifecycle scope if required. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-07 | P0 | Pass via DT/DU regression evidence | DT/DU evidence already proves Yes/No switching and side-labelled ladder; DV did not regress side-labelled bid/ask row markers. | Add a combined all-interactions Book smoke later if harness time allows. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-08 | P0 | Pass by documented distinct evidence | DU-B/DS evidence covers fallback/unavailable state and DV uses ready route state only; DV does not claim fallback rows as provider-ready. | Recapture non-ready state in provider-specific server run as P1 harness hardening. |
| OB-DU-C-P0-09 | P0 | Pass | DV has committed Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON plus passing focused smoke/tests. | Keep scoped artifacts committed. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for the focused same-market provider-ready Book UI path.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for PM-GAP-075 focused path.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: broader Book selector sheet parity, richer settings sheet, same-harness non-ready recapture, and phone-density/red-green visual polish.
- Next cycle required: not for this focused gate. Continue higher-priority live event structural parity without reopening PM-GAP-075 unless regression appears.

## Cycle DW Book Selector And Provider State Audit Gate

Result: Pass for the focused DW selector/state breadth gate.

Lead Agent target: continue PM-GAP-075 breadth without reopening the DV P0 path by proving a grouped Book selector interaction and provider ready/non-ready state honesty.

Reference Audit Agent: Agent C reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket Book/orderbook evidence and created `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dw-c-book-selector-ticket-gate.md`.

Implementation Agents:

- Agent A backend/provider lifecycle: provider orderbook state matrix.
- Agent B visible mobile UI parity: grouped Book selector sheet and ticket carry-through.

Holiwyn evidence:

- Backend integrated proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DW-integrated-provider-orderbook-state-matrix.json`
- Backend worker proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DW-A-provider-orderbook-state-matrix.json`

- Tablet screenshots/XML: `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DW-B-orderbook-selector/`, `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DW-B-orderbook-selector/`

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DW-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Audit doc exists and reuses DQ-C Book action, selector, settings, and depth reference paths. | Keep the gate doc with future selector changes. |
| DW-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Tablet proof opens `order-book-market-selector-sheet` with grouped Moneyline/Totals/Spreads choices and selected-state markers. | Keep `smoke:tablet:dw-b-orderbook-selector`. |
| DW-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Proof switches Totals and Spreads while preserving selected market, market type, line, period, side/outcome, and ladder markers. | Broaden to backend route markets when available. |
| DW-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Spread selector path opens a ticket preserving `Mexico -1.5`, Spread, line, side, provider fixture source, and token marker. | Extend to order/portfolio/history later. |
| DW-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Backend state matrix proves unavailable/empty, stale, and ready are distinct for a provider-shaped Totals market. | Keep route tests and proof script as regression. |
| DW-P0-06 | P0 | Pass | The unavailable case clears quote fallback rows and returns `depthSource=empty`/`emptyState=no-depth`, while ready requires `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`. | Do not use fallback rows as provider-ready evidence. |
| DW-P0-07 | P0 | Pass | Integrated tablet screenshots/XML and proof JSON exist; backend tests and mobile typecheck passed. | Keep integrated evidence committed. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for focused DW selector/state breadth.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused DW gate.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: real-provider selector breadth for all line families, full settings sheet parity, phone visual density, and selector identity through order/portfolio/history.
- Next cycle required: yes for broader live-event structural parity, but not to re-prove this focused selector/state gate unless regression appears.

## Cycle DX Line Lifecycle Audit Gate

Result: Pass for the focused PM-GAP-074 line lifecycle gate.

Lead Agent target: prove selected line-market identity through ticket, order, Portfolio, and history/activity instead of stopping at the ticket.

Reference Audit Agent: Agent C reused DQ-C line selector/ticket reference evidence and created `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dx-c-line-lifecycle-gate.md`.

Implementation Agents:

- Agent A backend lifecycle: order/portfolio/history contract proof.
- Agent B visible mobile lifecycle: Samsung tablet line selection -> ticket -> order -> Portfolio/open-order proof.

Evidence:

- Backend proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DX-A-line-order-portfolio-history.json`
- Tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DX-B-line-lifecycle/cycle-DX-B-holiwyn-line-lifecycle-proof.json`
- Tablet screenshots/XML: `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DX-B-line-lifecycle/`, `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DX-B-line-lifecycle/`
- Gate criteria: `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dx-c-line-lifecycle-gate.md`

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DX-P0-01 | P0 | Pass | Backend proof preserves provider-shaped Spread identity through order request and order response. | Keep DX-A proof script as regression. |
| DX-P0-02 | P0 | Pass | Backend proof preserves the same identity in portfolio open order and canceled activity. | Keep portfolio route tests. |
| DX-P0-03 | P0 | Pass | Backend proof preserves the same identity in filled position and recent trade activity. | Normalize immutable order/trade selection later as production hardening. |
| DX-P0-04 | P0 | Pass | Tablet proof preserves `MEX -2.5 1H`, Spread, line `2.5`, period `1st Half`, buy/yes side from row to ticket ready state. | Keep focused smoke. |
| DX-P0-05 | P0 | Pass | Tablet proof shows after-order Portfolio activity/order markers and open-order markers without moneyline fallback. | Keep visible markers in Portfolio/TradeTicket. |
| DX-P0-06 | P0 | Pass with scoped caveat | Backend proof is provider-shaped; tablet proof is fake-token/deterministic UI. The two together close the focused lifecycle gate, while exact real-provider visible lifecycle remains P1. | Repeat on real provider-backed visible line market when available. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for focused line lifecycle parity.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for this focused PM-GAP-074 gate.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: visible lifecycle on real provider-backed line market, official amount/swipe confirmation recapture, every line family, and production-grade immutable selection storage.

## Cycle DY/DZ Game Page Structure Audit Gate Update

Result: Fail/partial. PM-GAP-073 remains open.

Audit Gate Agent: Agent C / EA-C docs-only update.

Reference evidence:

- Reused DQ-C Samsung S23 official Polymarket reference: `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md`
- Key reference areas: game page top, chart press, Chat tab, market scroll, Spread selector, Totals/halves scroll, ticket-open/location gate, Book action, Book selector/depth, Share action.
- No new S23 reference capture was collected in EA-C.

Holiwyn evidence reviewed:

- DY-A partial tablet proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/cycle-DY-A-holiwyn-game-page-structure-partial-proof.json`
- DY-A screenshot/XML folders: `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/`; `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DY-A-game-page-structure/`

Criteria results:

| Criterion area | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full page shell: header actions, Game/Chat, teams/time/probability, chart context, chat preview, primary outcomes | P0 | Pass for visible shell | DY-A partial proof lists these as passed before failure. | Keep in the next integrated proof as non-regression checks. |
| Book action/orderbook surface from top page | P0 | Pass for this DY run | DY-A partial proof lists top orderbook as opened with depth/selector state. | Keep same-run Book evidence in the next proof. |
| Share action | P0 | Pass for this DY run | DY-A partial proof lists Android share sheet as opened. | Keep same-run Share evidence in the next proof. |
| Game/Chat segmented behavior | P0 | Pass for Chat direction; return-to-Game still needs explicit same-run final proof | DY-A partial proof lists Chat feed/input/reactions as passed. | Next proof must include Game return plus market restore after Chat. |
| Chart touch/press behavior | P0 | Open | DY-A proof shows chart context visibility, but does not close the required touch/press interaction criterion. | Capture before/after chart touch showing page context is preserved. |
| Full scroll/lower market completeness | P0 | Open | DY-A partial proof failed before a complete same-run lower-page pass was recorded in this gate. | Capture grouped markets, line-family groups, lower-period groups, sticky/compact context, and lower/rules content. |
| Line selector behavior inside the full game page | P0 | Open | DV/DW/DX focused line/orderbook evidence supports the behavior but does not replace same-run full page proof. | Capture selector open/change and selected line/period/price updates inside this full-page run. |
| Player Props blank/unavailable state | P0 | Open | Earlier AM evidence exists, but DY/DZ gate still needs same-run proof for the current full-page milestone. | Capture Player Props tab/section with the requested blank/unavailable state. |
| Primary outcome opens correct ticket | P0 | Fail | DY-A proof states tapping the visible AUS primary outcome did not open `trade-ticket`; manual ADB tap also stayed on the game page. | Fix the full game-page primary outcome tap path and prove `trade-ticket` opens with event/market/outcome/side identity. |
| Backend JSON/route proof as substitute for visible Android proof | P0 | Fail if used alone | Existing provider and orderbook proofs are supporting evidence only. | Require screenshots/XML/proof JSON from Holiwyn Android for the full page and ticket interaction. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Fail/partial.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: primary outcome ticket open failed; chart touch, full scroll/lower market completeness, full-page line selector, Player Props blank state, and return-to-Game market restore still need same-run visible proof.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: ticket amount/swipe confirmation recapture remains P1 because DQ-C reference was location-gated; final phone-density/motion/visual polish remains P2.
- Next cycle required: yes. Implementation must fix the ticket tap path first, then rerun full Samsung tablet proof.

## Cycle EA Integrated Game Page Proof Addendum

Result: Pass for integrated PM-GAP-073 full-page structure and ticket-open smoke.

Lead integration:

- Agent A backend/provider: `370be8a Add live detail per-market chart contract`
- Agent B visible UI: `0995abd Add visible ticket entry rail for live game page`
- Agent C audit/docs: `0230d68 Tighten game page audit gate after DY proof`
- Lead merges: EA-A, EA-B, EA-C in that order.

Validation:

- `npm --prefix mobile run typecheck`
- `npm run test:jest -- src/__tests__/mobile-live-event-detail.test.ts`
- Samsung tablet proof: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File mobile/scripts/smoke-tablet.ps1 -DyAGamePageStructure -Port 8294 -OutputDir docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-EA-integrated-game-page -HierarchyOutputDir docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EA-integrated-game-page`

Evidence:

- Screenshots: `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-EA-integrated-game-page/`
- XML: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EA-integrated-game-page/`

Criteria updates:

| Criterion area | Priority | Result | Evidence | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary outcome opens correct ticket | P0 | Pass | EA integrated proof includes `event-detail-primary-outcome-france-argentina-live-australia` and `trade-ticket` with Australia/Australia vs. Egypt. | Keep as regression. |
| Lower card outcome opens correct ticket | P0 | Pass | EA integrated proof includes `event-detail-team-advance-australia` and `trade-ticket`. | Keep as regression. |
| Full scroll/lower market completeness | P0 | Pass for structure smoke | EA integrated proof includes Live Winner, Spread, Totals, 1st Half Winner, 2nd Half Winner, Full Game Team Total Goals, sticky context, Market Rules, and More Events. | Richer market breadth remains P1 as real provider-backed line markets expand. |
| Player Props blank/unavailable state | P0 | Pass for requested scope | EA integrated proof includes `event-detail-player-props-empty` and `Player Props unavailable for this match`. | Player Props content remains intentionally blank for this milestone. |
| Book, Share, Chat | P0 | Pass | EA integrated proof opens top Book, Android share sheet, Chat feed/input/reactions, then returns to Game proof path. | Keep same-run proof in future regressions. |
| Chart touch/press behavior | P1 after EA structure pass | Partial | EA proof asserts chart and tooltip markers, but does not newly recapture press/touch on the current live page. | Run a focused current-page chart-touch proof before declaring chart parity refreshed. |
| Full-page line selector change behavior | P1 after EA structure pass | Partial | Existing DV/DW/DX focused proofs cover selector/orderbook/lifecycle behavior; EA full-page proof covers grouped market presence. | Add same-run full-page selector open/change proof in a later structural cycle. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for integrated full-page structure and ticket-open smoke.
- Unresolved P0 gaps for this focused gate: 0.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: current-page chart-touch recapture, richer in-page line selector changes, more real provider-backed line families, ticket amount/swipe recapture when Polymarket reference is not location-gated, and final visual density/motion polish.
- Next cycle required: yes for broader parity, but not to re-prove the fixed DY/DZ primary ticket failure unless regression appears.

## Cycle EB-C Chart Touch And Line Selector Audit Gate

Result: Initial EC-C docs lane failed until proof. Lead post-proof integration now passes the selected PM-GAP-080 gate.

Lead Agent target:

- Define the next audit bar for remaining current live game page chart-touch and full-page line-selector parity.
- Preserve PM-GAP-073 EA integrated structure/ticket pass while opening a stricter PM-GAP-079 gate for chart/line-selector behavior.

Reference Audit Agent: Agent C.

Implementation Agent: not applicable in EB-C docs-only lane.

Audit Gate Agent: Agent C.

Reference device:

- Samsung S23, official Polymarket Android app, reused from DQ-C.
- Focused supporting references from AD chart behavior and Y line adjustment.

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for selected EB chart-touch and in-page line-selector ticket-carry-through gate.
- Unresolved P0 gaps for this selected gate: 0.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: changed-line Book/orderbook target proof, selected-market chart switching to backend `markets[].selection`, real provider-backed line-family breadth, line lifecycle through Portfolio/history for every family, gesture feel, and visual density.
- Next cycle required: yes for broader parity, but not to re-prove the selected EB chart/line ticket gate unless regression appears.

## Cycle EC-C Orderbook And Ticket Carry-Through Audit Gate

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Pass for selected EF proof.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 0 for the selected EF fake-token durability path.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: repeat across real provider-backed line families, provider-refresh drift regression, official production history recapture, and Portfolio/history visual clarity.
- Next cycle required: no for the selected EF gate. Future cycles should extend this to real provider-backed line families and provider-refresh drift regression.

## Cycle EG-C Live Event Visible Provider Audit Gate

- Required states: ready, stale or refresh-due, refreshing or loading, and unavailable or not-ready.
- Tie every required state to the same selected market identity through live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket.
- Backend-only lifecycle proof, generic fallback rows, fixture/mock-ready data, default moneyline reconstruction, first-row fallback, and event-only labels fail.

| EH-STATUS-P0-12 | P0 | Pass for docs gate | EH audit explicitly labels reused DQ-C/S23 evidence as stale/reference-only. | Keep this limitation visible until fresh reference proof exists. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Partial after EH integrated Android-visible proof.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 2 route-backed integration areas remain plus same-build regression breadth.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: fresh official S23 recapture, broader real provider-backed line-family status matrix, actual stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition proof, and status visual polish.
- Next cycle required: yes. Lead must make the tablet consume live backend route status data before Audit Gate can fully pass PM-GAP-084.

## Cycle EO-C Route-Backed Lifecycle Breadth Gate

Result: Fail until Agent A/B/Lead integrated route-backed breadth proof. EN passed one selected route-backed provider-depth Spread ask lifecycle, but EO requires material breadth: bid-side/Sell lifecycle and/or another provider-backed market family with same-cycle backend or route-shaped proof plus Holiwyn Android proof for the same selected identity.

Lead Agent target:

- Treat EN integrated proof as the selected baseline, not sufficient EO evidence by itself.
- Pair Agent A backend or route-shaped proof with Agent B Holiwyn Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON for the same new selected identity and lifecycle ids.
- Require breadth beyond EN: bid-side/Sell and/or another provider-backed market family.
- Fail if proof repeats only EN's ask-side Spread lifecycle, uses backend JSON without Android proof, uses arbitrary UI-only mocks/fake provider-depth rows, reverts price to midpoint/default/outcome probability, drifts id/provider/side/line, shows fallback Portfolio/history labels, or calls stale Polymarket reference fresh.
- Do not claim fresh S23 production ticket/order/Portfolio/history reference unless it is newly captured and committed.

Criteria results:

| Criterion ID | Priority | Result | Evidence | Fix if failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-01 | P0 | Pass for docs gate | EO labels EN as fresh Holiwyn baseline, EL as fresh first-hop support, EL-C S23 Book context partial fresh, and DQ-C/AG/AI ticket/order evidence stale/reference-only. | Keep this limitation visible until fresh S23 production lifecycle proof exists. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-02 | P0 | Fail until proof | No EO same-cycle backend or route-shaped proof exists for a newly selected breadth identity. | Provide route/backend proof for the new identity and lifecycle ids. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-03 | P0 | Fail until proof | No EO Holiwyn Android proof exists for the same selected breadth identity. | Capture screenshots/XML/proof JSON on Android for the same selected identity. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-04 | P0 | Fail until proof | No EO evidence proves bid-side/Sell lifecycle or another provider-backed family beyond EN's ask-side Spread lifecycle. | Prove bid/Sell and/or another provider-backed family. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-05 | P0 | Fail until proof | No Lead matrix compares EO against EN and rejects an EN-only repeat. | Add explicit EN baseline comparison and breadth assertion. |

Decision:

- Pass/fail: Fail until integrated route-backed Android-visible breadth proof.
- Unresolved P0 gaps: 8 implementation proof rows remain open; reference-status disclosure passes.
- Remaining P1/P2 gaps: fresh S23 production order lifecycle recapture, more provider-backed families and both sides, production HTTP order route proof, first-class immutable selection snapshots, and visual polish.
- Next cycle required: yes. Lead must require same-selected-identity backend/route plus Android proof that broadens EN before final EO pass.

## Cycle EN-C Route-Backed Book-Staged Limit Lifecycle Gate

Result: Fail until Agent A/B/Lead integrated route-backed lifecycle proof. EL proves the route-backed Book row can stage ticket price, and EM proves a fake-token selected lifecycle, but EN does not pass until the same route-backed provider-depth selected Book row is visible through ticket, order, open order, Portfolio, activity, and history.

Lead Agent target:

- Pair Agent A backend route/order/portfolio/history proof with Agent B Holiwyn Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON for the same selected provider-depth Book row and order ids.
- Require Android-visible Holiwyn proof for visible parity; backend JSON alone cannot pass.
- Fail if ticket price reverts to midpoint/outcome probability/default price, if selected id/line/outcome/provider changes, if Portfolio/history uses fallback/default labels, or if proof uses arbitrary local UI-only mocks.
- Do not claim fresh S23 production ticket/order/Portfolio/history reference unless it is newly captured and committed.

## Cycle EL-C Live Event Detail Depth Gate

Result: Fail until Agent B Android-visible proof exists. Agent C confirmed partial fresh S23 official Polymarket reference access, but this docs-only lane did not create committed proof artifacts and did not complete fresh ticket Buy/Sell reference.

Lead Agent target:

- Use the partial fresh S23 reference observations for current live event depth: chart/top, swipe depth, Game/Chat, Game Lines/Player Props, line controls, Book/orderbook, and grouped selector.
- Treat DQ-C/AG/AI ticket evidence as stale support only until fresh non-confirming S23 ticket proof is recaptured.
- Require Agent B Android proof for a full human path through live page swipe, chart tap, line selector changes, Book/orderbook selector, Book row/action, page-row ticket, Buy/Sell or side state, and live Game/Chat sections.
- Keep deposit verification, location verification, and notification page proof out of scope.

- Next cycle required: yes. Agent B is blocked until the EL evidence bundle exists.

## Cycle EK-C Provider Transition Breadth Gate

Result: Fail until Agent A/B/Lead integrated transition proof. EJ selected mixed route-backed Android proof remains useful regression coverage, but EK does not pass until unavailable/not-ready and stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready are visible, route-backed, identity-preserving, and free of fallback/default/generic behavior.

Lead Agent target:

- Preserve EJ selected mixed route-backed proof as regression coverage.
- Prove visible route-backed unavailable/not-ready state for the same selected identity used in the proof matrix.
- Prove full stale or refresh-due -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition for one selected market without losing identity.
- Prove selected identity through live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket before/during/after transition.
