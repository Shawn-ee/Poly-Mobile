# Polymarket Feature Criteria

Purpose: convert same-cycle Polymarket audits into pass/fail Holiwyn criteria.

Rule: every completed Holiwyn feature must have criteria here or in a focused audit file linked from this file. Every P0 must be objectively auditable.

## Priority Definitions

P0: required for parity baseline. If any P0 fails, the feature is not complete.

P1: required for near parity. May remain open only when explicitly tracked and accepted for a later cycle.

P2: polish. May remain open when tracked and not confusing or blocking.

## Universal P0 Criteria

These apply to every page, feature, button, and interaction:

| ID | Criterion | Audit method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U-P0-01 | Same-cycle Polymarket reference audit exists for the exact feature. | Audit file and reference screenshot/hierarchy path. |
| U-P0-02 | Holiwyn Android device proof exists for the exact feature. | Screenshot/hierarchy/proof log path. |
| U-P0-03 | Every visible button/control either performs the expected Polymarket-equivalent action, opens the correct Holiwyn equivalent, or is explicitly disabled with a clear reason. | Device smoke and UI hierarchy. |
| U-P0-04 | Selected market, line, outcome, and tab state persist through navigation/ticket/portfolio flows when Polymarket preserves them. | Device smoke, route test, or state test. |
| U-P0-05 | Holiwyn does not use copied Polymarket logos, trademarks, protected text, proprietary images, or private assets. | Review. |
| U-P0-06 | Empty, loading, disabled, and error states are not static placeholders when Polymarket has meaningful behavior. | Device smoke and screenshots. |
| U-P0-07 | Visual hierarchy is not meaningfully worse or confusing compared with the Polymarket reference for the selected feature. | Audit Gate comparison. |
| U-P0-08 | Audit Gate Agent marks the feature pass with 0 unresolved P0 gaps. | Audit Gate report. |

## Feature Criteria Register

| Feature | Criteria owner file | P0 status | P1/P2 status | Latest gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search UI route wiring | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KJ-search-ui-route-wiring.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Visible Search tab server mode consumes backend `/api/events?search=...&limit=...&cursor=...` pages and cursor metadata instead of filtering only the loaded Home page. | P1 ranked/faceted discovery only if Search scope expands; optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again | Cycle KJ pass |
| Account balance route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KI-account-balance-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadAccountBalance()` reads canonical `/api/account/balance`, maps available/locked/total USDC into numeric visible cash values, and keeps local balance fallback route-unavailable only. | P1 Account/Portfolio UI standalone balance wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 legacy wallet-balance cleanup after canonical route adoption | Cycle KI pass |
| Event market catalog contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KH-event-market-catalog-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadEventMarketCatalog()` prefers `/api/events/:slug/markets`, normalizes public listed route markets into Game Lines market metadata, and keeps successful empty route results empty. | P1 Event Detail UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 optional Android line-chip route-refresh proof if visual proof becomes required again | Cycle KH pass |
| Event Detail hydration contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KG-event-detail-hydration-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `PolyApi.getEvent()` prefers `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, keeps legacy `/api/events/:slug` as failure fallback only, and the compact route carries backend-owned market rules plus compact regulation draw and spread rows. | P1 Event Detail UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 production real-provider replay remains under provider lanes | Cycle KG pass |
| Ticket quote route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KF-ticket-quote-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadTicketQuotes()` reads `/api/markets/:id/quote`, maps best bid/ask, top-of-book sizes, midpoint probability, and last trade price into ticket quote fields. | P1 visible Trade Ticket/Event Detail quote refresh wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 production provider quote breadth remains under provider lanes | Cycle KF pass |
| Portfolio sync route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KE-portfolio-sync-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadServerPortfolioState()` reads backend `/api/portfolio` plus `/api/portfolio/history`, maps positions/open orders/activities, and preserves backend selection metadata. | P1 Portfolio UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again | Cycle KE pass |
| Home event filter contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KD-home-event-filter-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadHomeEventFeedPage()` prefers backend `/api/events?status=...&limit=...&cursor=...` pages, preserves compact markets, and isolates local filtering to route-unavailable fallback. | P1 Home/Live UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 calendar-accurate today filtering only if product keeps a date-window tab | Cycle KD pass |
| Profile summary contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KC-profile-summary-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. `/api/profile/summary` returns canonical profile identity, preferences, wallet/account totals, open position/order counts, open order value, total exposure, and mobile `loadProfileSummary()` maps it to Account values. | P1 Account UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; broader account/security/session/funding settings remain outside focused MVP scope | Cycle KC pass |
| Search event service contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KB-search-event-service-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `loadSearchEventPage()` prefers backend `/api/events?search=...&limit=...&cursor=...` pages, preserves compact markets, and isolates local filtering to route-unavailable fallback. | P1 Search UI server-mode wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 ranked/faceted discovery only if World Cup MVP Search scope expands | Cycle KB pass |
| Trade Ticket submit route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-KA-trade-ticket-submit-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile `submitTicketOrder()` reaches real `POST /api/orders`, passes internal trading/provider availability gates, and Portfolio hydrates the created open order with selected totals identity. | P1 visible Trade Ticket submit Android proof after dirty UI churn is reconciled; P1 broader provider-family submit breadth if needed | Cycle KA pass |
| Open order cancel route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JZ-open-order-cancel-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Server-mode mobile cancel calls `DELETE /api/orders/:id`, Portfolio removes the open order after cancel, and history/activity preserve selected market identity. | P1 visible Portfolio Orders tab Android proof after dirty UI churn is reconciled; P1 broader provider-family cancel breadth if needed | Cycle JZ pass |
| Portfolio value-history service contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JY-portfolio-value-history-service-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile service prefers `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=...` route data when an API client is available and keeps deterministic history as fallback only. | P1 Portfolio UI wiring after dirty screen churn is reconciled; P1 Android proof that visible chart source is route-backed in server mode | Cycle JY pass |
| Line options contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JX-line-options-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope.

| Profile preferences route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JU-profile-preferences-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Mobile/server preference payloads preserve locale, ticket default amount, ticket side, slippage, and saved event ids through canonical `/api/profile/preferences` read/write shape. | P1 full account/settings shell contract; P1 UI-level server sync proof after unrelated mobile UI churn is reconciled | Cycle JU pass |
| Search event route contract | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JT-search-event-route-contract.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. `/api/events?search=` matches event/team/market/outcome text, returns compact mobile markets, and preserves cursor pagination. | P1 Search tab UI server-mode backend wiring after unrelated mobile UI churn is reconciled; P1 ranked/faceted production discovery if needed | Cycle JT pass |
| Cashout route sell safety | `mobile/docs/audits/cycle-JS-cashout-route-sell-safety.md` | Pass for focused backend/data-contract scope. Backend rejects no-position and oversell `SELL` attempts through canonical order submission with stored `409`/`INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` responses, valid full-position sell can proceed, and mobile blocks non-finite cashout shares before submit. | P1 optional external HTTP auth-stack smoke for `POST /api/orders` if future gates require API-key-level proof | Cycle JS pass |
| Route-backed lifecycle breadth after EN | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eo-c-route-lifecycle-breadth-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-breadth-proof for EO. EN passed one selected route-backed provider-depth Spread ask lifecycle, so EO requires same-cycle backend or route-shaped proof plus Holiwyn Android proof for a materially broader selected identity: bid-side/Sell and/or another provider-backed market family. Repeating only EN's ask-side Spread path fails. | P1/P2 remaining: fresh S23 production order lifecycle recapture, more provider-backed families and both sides, production HTTP order route proof, first-class immutable selection snapshots, and lifecycle label/visual polish | EO-C docs gate; PM-GAP-089 open |
| Route-backed provider-depth Book-staged limit lifecycle EN | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-en-c-route-limit-lifecycle-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-proof for EN route-backed provider-depth lifecycle. EL proves a route-backed Book row can stage ask 55c and bid 50c into tickets, and EM proves a selected fake-token lifecycle, but EN requires the same route-backed provider-depth selected Book row through ticket amount/submit, order snapshot, open order, Portfolio, activity, and history. Backend JSON, arbitrary local UI-only mocks, or fake provider-depth rows without Android-visible route-backed proof fail. | P1/P2 remaining: fresh S23 production ticket/order/history recapture, multi-family/both-side route-backed breadth, durable DB-backed snapshots after provider refresh/metadata drift, and lifecycle label/visual polish | EN-C docs gate; PM-GAP-088 open |
| Book-staged selected limit lifecycle after EL | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-em-c-limit-lifecycle-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-proof for EM selected Book limit lifecycle. Fresh EL integrated Holiwyn proof preserves ask 55c and bid 50c into Buy/Sell tickets, but EM requires the same selected limit fields through amount entry, order snapshot, open order, Portfolio, activity, and history. Backend JSON without Android Holiwyn lifecycle proof fails. | P1/P2 remaining: repeat across multiple market families and both sides, recapture official Polymarket production order/history when gates allow, prove durability after refresh/metadata drift, and polish lifecycle labels | EM-C docs gate; PM-GAP-087 open |
| Live event detail depth after EK | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-el-c-live-event-depth-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-proof for EL live event detail depth. Partial fresh S23 official Polymarket reference exists for chart/top, swiped market sections, Game/Chat, line controls, Book/orderbook, and grouped selector; ticket Buy/Sell remains stale-context only. Agent B is blocked without Android-visible Holiwyn proof. | P1/P2 remaining: fresh S23 ticket Buy/Sell recapture, multi-family provider breadth, Book row-to-ticket price/side carry-through, Player Props/lower-section breadth, and visual/chart/orderbook polish | EL-C docs gate; PM-GAP-086 open |
| Route-backed provider transition breadth after EJ | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ek-c-provider-transition-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-proof for EK transition breadth. EJ selected mixed route-backed Android path remains regression coverage, but EK requires visible route-backed unavailable/not-ready state, full same-selected-market stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition, selected identity preservation across live page/chart/Book/ticket, no fallback/default/generic market behavior, and real-provider family breadth if available. | P1/P2 remaining: expand transition proof to every real provider-backed family when available, repeat transitions across more than one family, fresh official S23 recapture, and status/density polish | EK-C docs gate; PM-GAP-085 open |
| Route-backed provider status breadth after EI | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ej-c-provider-status-breadth-gate.md` | Fail-until-integrated-proof for EJ breadth. EI selected route-backed ready/Book/ticket path remains verified, but EJ requires new Agent A/B/Lead proof for real provider-backed family breadth, route-backed stale/refresh-due, route-backed unavailable/not-ready, full stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition, and no fallback/default proof substitutes. | P1/P2 remaining: expand to every real provider-backed family when available, fresh official S23 recapture, repeated transition breadth, and status/density polish | EJ-C docs gate; PM-GAP-085 open |
| Live event route-backed provider lifecycle/status parity EI | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ei-c-route-backed-status-gate.md` | Pass for selected EI integrated route-backed tablet status proof. The selected path proves backend health/reachability, route-backed ready live page, Book refreshing/loading, route-backed ready depth, ticket provider identity, server mode, and no deterministic fixture/mock-ready/default fallback. | P1/P2 remaining moved to EJ breadth: fresh official S23 recapture, broader real provider-backed line-family status matrix, actual route-backed stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition proof, and status visual polish | EI integrated selected pass; PM-GAP-084 verified for selected path |
| Live event visible provider lifecycle/status parity EH | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eh-c-provider-status-gate.md` | Partial for selected EH integrated proof. Android proof now shows ready, refresh-due, refreshing, and not-ready states through live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket handoff, and backend proof shows route status fields. P0 remains open for tablet-visible status rendering sourced from the live backend route rather than deterministic contract fixture status UI. | P1/P2 remaining: fresh official S23 recapture, broader real provider-backed line-family status matrix, actual stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition proof, and status visual polish | EH integrated partial; PM-GAP-084 remains open |
| Live event visible provider behavior and structural parity EG | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eg-c-live-event-visible-provider-gate.md` | Partial for selected EG integrated proof. Android proof now covers chart touch, line selector changes, chart-to-Book, and chart-to-ticket identity for the selected Spread path, and backend proof covers provider refresh lifecycle. P0 remains open for same-run visible ready/stale/refreshing/unavailable status proof tied to the backend route, no-fallback status handling, and prior-gate non-regression in the same build. | P1/P2 remaining: fresh official S23 recapture, broader real provider-backed line-family breadth, visible stale/refreshing/ready lifecycle, and live-page visual/status polish | EG integrated partial; PM-GAP-084 remains open |
| Book-origin snapshot durability after metadata drift EF | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ef-c-snapshot-durability-gate.md` | Pass for selected EF integrated gate. P0 proof preserves order-time/fill-time selected Book identity after mutable market/outcome/provider metadata drift in backend routes and Android Portfolio/activity, with no fallback/default reconstruction and explicit fake-token labels | P1/P2 remaining: repeat across real provider-backed line families, provider-refresh drift regression, official production history recapture, and Portfolio/history visual clarity | EF integrated gate pass; PM-GAP-083 verified for selected lifecycle |
| Book-origin order status breadth and selection snapshots EE | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ee-c-book-order-status-gate.md` | Pass for selected EE integrated gate. P0 proof preserves the same Book-origin Spread identity across open order, cancel/canceled status, filled position, recent activity/history, Android-visible fake-token status labels, backend route/data proof, guarded selection snapshots, and no fallback | P1/P2 remaining: real provider-backed line-family status matrix, official production confirmation/cancel/fill recapture, durability checks after metadata changes, and Portfolio/history visual status polish | EE integrated gate pass; PM-GAP-082 verified for selected lifecycle |
| Book-selected order to Portfolio/history ED lifecycle | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ed-c-book-order-portfolio-gate.md` | Pass for selected ED integrated gate. P0 proof starts on the live game page Book surface, selects Spread `1.5` regulation Yes, opens the matching ticket, submits a fake-token order, and preserves the same selected identity through Android-visible Portfolio open order/open position/activity plus backend order/portfolio/history route proof | P1/P2 remaining: real provider-backed line-family lifecycle breadth, open/cancel/fill status breadth, production confirmation recapture, immutable selection snapshots, and Portfolio/history visual polish | ED integrated gate pass; PM-GAP-081 verified for selected lifecycle |
| Line-market lifecycle DX | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dx-c-line-lifecycle-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dr-c-line-market-ticket-target-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dw-c-book-selector-ticket-gate.md` | Pass for focused lifecycle gate. Backend proof preserves provider-shaped Spread identity through order request, order response, open order, canceled activity, filled position, and recent trade; Android proof preserves visible `MEX -2.5 1H` through row, ticket, order, Portfolio activity, and open order | P1/P2 remaining: repeat visible lifecycle on real provider-backed line market, official amount/swipe confirmation recapture, every line family, and production immutable selection storage | DX focused gate pass |
| Orderbook family/depth selector DW grouped selector/state breadth | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dw-c-book-selector-ticket-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md` | Pass for focused DW gate. Android proof shows a grouped Book selector sheet with Moneyline/Totals/Spreads selection and Spread ticket carry-through; backend proof shows unavailable/empty, stale, and ready provider orderbook states are distinct and fallback rows are not counted as ready | P1/P2 remaining: real-provider selector breadth for every line family, full settings sheet, phone visual density, and selector identity through order/portfolio/history | DW focused gate pass |
| Orderbook family/depth selector DV provider-ready UI | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md` | Verified for the focused same-market provider-ready Book path. DV ties backend `provider-orderbook-depth` JSON for market `d08da13e-80b8-4452-9067-f91d08f6fba4` to the Android-visible Book UI with selector key `spreads:first-half:1.5`, ready route status, Spread line/period state, Cents/Decimal setting preservation, and ticket carry-through to `Japan -1.5` | P1/P2 remaining: broader selector sheet coverage, richer settings sheet behavior, server non-ready recapture in the provider-specific harness, and phone-density/visual polish | DV focused gate pass |
| Orderbook family/depth selector DU integrated | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md` | Superseded by DV. DU was partial because provider-ready backend depth and visible Book UI proof were separate evidence bundles | Keep DU evidence as background for settings/selector/ticket behavior; use DV as the same-market provider-ready regression proof | Superseded by DV |
| Orderbook family/depth selector DU-C final gate | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-du-c-orderbook-final-gate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md` | Passed for the focused same-market provider-ready path after DV proof. OB-DU-C-P0-01/02/03/04/05/06/09 now have Android-visible evidence; OB-DU-C-P0-07 remains covered by DT/DU regression evidence; OB-DU-C-P0-08 remains documented by non-ready/fallback evidence rather than recaptured in the DV ready-only server run | Remaining P1/P2 polish: complete Polymarket selector/settings parity and tighter phone visuals | DV focused gate pass |
| Orderbook family/depth selector DT integrated | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dt-c-orderbook-regate.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ds-c-orderbook-audit-gate.md` | Partial. DT integrated proof exists for Yes/No tab switching, selector carry-through into a Totals ticket, side-labelled ladder markers, and backend provider-backed ready depth route; PM-GAP-075 remains open | Required remaining proof: provider-backed ready depth visible in the same UI run, Spread/period/line selector carry-through, and Decimalize/equivalent Book setting. P1 broader selector coverage, row-to-ticket carry-through polish, and P2 visual polish remain open after gate pass | DT integrated partial; not parity-pass |
| Line-market ticket target parity DR-C | `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-dr-c-line-market-ticket-target-gate.md` | Focused P0 pass after integrated Samsung tablet proof for selected market family, line, period, side/outcome, odds/probability, and ticket target identity | DQ-C production ticket amount/swipe recapture remains P1 due to location gate; Book/order/portfolio/history coupling stays under PM-GAP-074 | Pass for focused ticket-target gate |
| Live football / World Cup game detail DQ-C | `docs/mobile/audits/live-football-world-cup-dq-c.md` | Fresh S23 reference P0 criteria added for full page hierarchy, chart press, line-state coupling, Book/depth ladder, active buttons/actions, tab behavior, and scroll behavior; Holiwyn not marked complete | P1 ticket amount/swipe confirmation recapture remains blocked by Polymarket location gate; P1 full Book market-selector parity and P2 visual/motion polish remain open | Reference audit only |
| Live event detail | `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail.md`; `docs/mobile/audits/live-event-detail-super-round-dm.md` | DN super-round P0 criteria are documented for Polymarket-first match-winner provider mapping, CLOB chart history, route-backed depth, Buy/Sell ticket identity, and honest stale/closed state handling | P1 exact line-family provider markets, filled-order/history lifecycle proof, and scheduled refresh remain open; P2 visual density/motion polish remains deferred | Pass for Cycles DK-DM evidence; Agent A/B must re-run final device proof against implementation build |

## Required Special Coverage

Adjustable line markets:

- Spreads.
- Totals.
- Team totals.
- Corners.
- Halves.
- Other discovered line-based markets.

Chart behavior:

- Probability movement.
- Selected outcome state.
- Time range if present.
- Tooltip or press behavior if present.
- Empty/loading behavior.

Trade ticket:

- Buy/Sell switching.
- Amount entry.
- Odds/probability updates.
- Payout/cost calculation.
- Line selection carry-through.
- Confirmation/error state.

Live event detail DN super-round required checks:

- Chart source must be `polymarket-clob-prices-history` or an explicitly documented unavailable/stale state for provider-backed markets.
- Line selectors must be provider-backed for the selected line/outcome, or explicitly unavailable/stale/unsupported when current Polymarket reference exposes no line-family market.
- Orderbook/depth must use route-backed provider data and expose best bid, best ask, spread, price, shares, and total.
- Buy/Sell ticket must preserve selected provider source, external market, condition, outcome token, outcome label, market type, group, period, line, and side.
- Closed/resolved events must not be shown as current-live ready; stale/ended state is acceptable and required when the provider says so.

## Cycle EO-C Route-Backed Lifecycle Breadth Gate Criteria

The focused EO-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eo-c-route-lifecycle-breadth-gate.md` opens PM-GAP-089 for route-backed lifecycle breadth after EN. EN integrated is the selected baseline for one ask-side Spread route-backed lifecycle; EO must prove a broader route-backed identity and cannot pass by repeating only that path.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-01 | P0 | Fresh/stale/reference-only evidence status must be explicit and no fresh S23 production lifecycle parity may be claimed without fresh capture. | Docs label EN as fresh Holiwyn baseline, EL as fresh first-hop support, EL-C S23 Book context as partial fresh reference, DQ-C/AG/AI as stale/reference-only, and no fresh EO production lifecycle reference as collected. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-02 | P0 | Same-cycle backend or route-shaped proof must exist for the new selected breadth identity. | Route/backend proof with matching route status/source, provider/source, market id or selector key, side, price, shares/value, lifecycle ids, and no fallback rows. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-03 | P0 | Holiwyn Android proof must exist for the same selected identity. | Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON for the same event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, row price/side, and lifecycle ids. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-04 | P0 | EO must materially broaden EN. | Proof covers bid-side/Sell lifecycle and/or another provider-backed market family beyond EN's selected ask-side Spread lifecycle. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-05 | P0 | Repeating only EN's ask-side Spread path fails. | Lead matrix explicitly compares EO against EN and shows at least one new side/family. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-06 | P0 | Ticket, submit, order, open order, Portfolio/open position, activity, history, and status transitions must preserve the selected breadth snapshot. | Backend/route proof paired with Android-visible proof for the same order/fill/cancel/status ids, selected price/side, market/outcome/line/period/provider/source, and fake-token label when applicable. |
| EO-BREADTH-P0-07 | P0 | Fallback/default labels, midpoint/default price reversion, id/provider drift, backend-only proof, and UI-only mocks fail. | Negative assertions reject event-only, moneyline, first-row, generic team, generic Yes/No, default probability, fake provider-depth rows, stale metadata, missing provider, and backend JSON without Android proof. |
| EO-BREADTH-P1-01 | P1 | Recapture fresh official S23 production order lifecycle when gates allow. | Fresh Samsung S23 official-app Book row -> ticket -> production order/open order/history proof, or documented blocked state. |
| EO-BREADTH-P1-02 | P1 | Continue breadth across more provider-backed families and both sides. | Route-backed Android/backend proof for Spread plus more available families, covering ask->Buy and bid->Sell. |
| EO-BREADTH-P1-03 | P1 | Capture production HTTP order route proof. | HTTP route proof for order submit/open/cancel/history paired to the Android-visible selected identity. |
| EO-BREADTH-P1-04 | P1 | Add first-class immutable selection snapshots. | Database-backed selection snapshots survive provider refresh, metadata drift, cancel/fill, and app relaunch. |
| EO-BREADTH-P2-01 | P2 | Polish lifecycle labels and visual scan clarity. | Side-by-side visual QA after P0 breadth proof passes. |

## Cycle EN-C Route-Backed Book-Staged Limit Lifecycle Gate Criteria

The focused EN-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-en-c-route-limit-lifecycle-gate.md` opens PM-GAP-088 for the route-backed provider-depth version of the Book-staged limit lifecycle. EM integrated remains a selected fake-token lifecycle pass, and EL integrated remains first-hop route-backed Book-to-ticket support; neither passes EN without route-backed Android proof through order, Portfolio, activity, and history.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-01 | P0 | Fresh/stale/reference-only evidence status must be explicit and no fresh S23 production order parity may be claimed without fresh capture. | Docs label EL/EM Holiwyn proof as fresh support, EL-C S23 Book context as partial fresh reference, and DQ-C/AG/AI ticket/order context as stale/reference-only. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-02 | P0 | The selected Book row must be route-backed provider depth, not arbitrary local UI-only mock data. | Backend route proof plus Android Book proof with matching route status/source, provider/source, market id or selector key, row side, price, shares, value, and depth source. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-03 | P0 | The selected route-backed Book row must stage the exact price and side into ticket. | Android proof for ask->Buy and bid->Sell, or documented same-run side unavailability, with no midpoint/outcome probability/default price reversion. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-04 | P0 | Ticket amount/ready/submit state must preserve selected route-backed identity. | Android ticket proof after amount entry plus proof JSON showing price, side, row shares/value, market/outcome/line/period/provider/source, route depth source, and fake-token label when applicable. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-05 | P0 | Order request/response must snapshot selected route-backed Book limit fields. | Backend order JSON paired with Android submit proof for the same order id and selected row. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-06 | P0 | Open order, Portfolio/open position, activity, and history must render the order-time selected route-backed snapshot. | Android screenshots/XML plus backend route proof showing unchanged price, side, selected id/line/outcome/provider, order/fill/cancel/status ids, and fake-token/test labels. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-07 | P0 | Selected identity must not change across the lifecycle. | Lead matrix maps Book -> ticket -> order -> open order -> Portfolio -> activity/history by order id plus event, market id/selector key, outcome id, line, period, side, provider/source, condition/token, price, and shares/value. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-08 | P0 | Portfolio/history fallback/default labels fail visible parity. | Negative assertions reject event-only, moneyline, first-row, generic team, generic Yes/No, default probability, stale metadata, missing provider, and missing selected id labels. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-09 | P0 | Backend JSON alone cannot pass visible parity. | Backend proof must be paired to Holiwyn Android screenshots/XML/proof JSON for the same selected row and ids. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P0-10 | P0 | Proof using arbitrary local UI-only mocks or fake provider-depth rows fails. | Negative assertions reject UI-only mocks, deterministic fake rows presented as route-backed provider depth, stale-as-ready route behavior, and backend-unreachable fallback. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P1-01 | P1 | Recapture fresh official S23 production order lifecycle when gates allow. | Fresh Samsung S23 official-app Book row -> ticket -> production order/open order/history proof, or documented blocked state. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P1-02 | P1 | Repeat across multiple route-backed market families and both sides. | Android/backend proof for Spread plus another available family, covering ask->Buy and bid->Sell. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P1-03 | P1 | Prove durable DB-backed snapshots after provider refresh/metadata drift. | Database-backed selection snapshots stay unchanged through refresh, drift, cancel/fill, and app relaunch. |
| EN-ROUTE-LIMIT-P2-01 | P2 | Polish order/Portfolio/history lifecycle labels and visual scan clarity. | Side-by-side visual QA after P0 route-backed lifecycle proof passes. |

## Cycle EM-C Book-Staged Limit Lifecycle Gate Criteria

The focused EM-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-em-c-limit-lifecycle-gate.md` opens PM-GAP-087 for the next Book/orderbook lifecycle milestone after EL. EL integrated proof is fresh Holiwyn support for selected Book ask/bid price preservation into the ticket; Polymarket ticket/order/Portfolio/history reference remains stale or blocked and must be labeled as such.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EM-LIMIT-P0-01 | P0 | Fresh-vs-stale evidence status is explicit and no Polymarket production parity is claimed without Android Holiwyn proof. | Docs label partial fresh EL-C S23 Book reference, fresh EL Holiwyn ticket-price proof, and stale DQ-C/AG/AI ticket/order support. |
| EM-LIMIT-P0-02 | P0 | A tapped Book ask/bid row must stage the exact selected limit price into the ticket. | Android proof showing tapped row price/side/shares and ticket price for ask->Buy and bid->Sell, with no midpoint/outcome probability reversion. |

| EM-LIMIT-P0-06 | P0 | Status changes such as open, canceled, filled, or partially filled must not drop limit fields. | Lifecycle proof showing unchanged limit snapshot across status transitions. |
| EM-LIMIT-P0-07 | P0 | Fallback/default labels fail the lifecycle. | Negative assertions reject event-only, first-row, moneyline, generic team, generic Yes/No, fallback market, default probability, stale metadata, or missing provider/source labels. |
| EM-LIMIT-P0-08 | P0 | Backend JSON without Android-visible Holiwyn proof cannot pass. | Lead proof matrix maps backend JSON to visible Android ticket/order/Portfolio/activity/history markers for the same ids. |
| EM-LIMIT-P1-01 | P1 | Repeat across multiple market families and both Book sides. | Spread plus another family where provider-backed depth exists; ask->Buy and bid->Sell covered. |

## Cycle EL-C Live Event Detail Depth Gate Criteria

The focused EL-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-el-c-live-event-depth-gate.md` opens PM-GAP-086 for the next live event page depth milestone after EK. Agent C confirmed connected S23 official Polymarket app access and captured partial fresh reference observations for chart/top context, swipe depth, Game/Chat, line controls, Book/orderbook, and grouped selector. Ticket Buy/Sell fresh reference remains incomplete and stale DQ-C/AG/AI ticket evidence is support-only.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-01 | P0 | Same-build Android-visible Holiwyn proof must exist for live event detail depth. | Screenshots/XML/proof JSON from one device session covering live page, chart, market sections, Book/orderbook, selector, and ticket. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-02 | P0 | Fresh/stale reference status must be stated honestly. | Audit notes identify partial fresh S23 reference and stale ticket support as stale context only. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-03 | P0 | Page swipes must preserve event context and selected identity. | Before/after proof showing same event, market family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, and market id or selector key after scrolling. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-04 | P0 | Chart behavior must be selected-market aware and interactive. | Chart tap proof showing selected event/outcome/market context, visible movement or press/selected state, and no unintended ticket/Book/share/chat navigation. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-05 | P0 | Live game sections must behave like real product surfaces, not placeholders. | Game/Chat proof plus live preview/section behavior, persistent event header, and outcome actions where present; deposit/location/notification pages are skipped. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-06 | P0 | Market sections must expose real page depth comparable to Polymarket. | Regulation Time Winner, Spread, Totals, and at least one lower section or unavailable Player Props state are visible and interactive/explicit. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-07 | P0 | Line and period controls must update one coherent selected identity. | Spread or Totals proof showing line value, period, subject/team/outcome, odds/probabilities, selected row styling, and provider/source identity update together. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-08 | P0 | Book/orderbook must open from the selected live event and preserve identity. | Android proof of Book title/event, Yes/No tabs, grouped selector, selected family/line/period/side, provider/source/status, Price/Shares/Value columns, bid/ask rows, and spread/ask/bid distinction when depth exists. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-09 | P0 | Book grouped selector must preserve market family identity. | Selector proof showing Moneyline plus Spread/Totals or available families, visible selected check, and no reset to a default market after selection. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-10 | P0 | Ticket handoff must preserve selected page or Book identity. | Ticket proof from page row and Book action/row showing event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id/selector key, price/odds, Buy/Sell or side state, and fake-token/test labels if applicable. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-11 | P0 | Non-ready/loading/unavailable states must be explicit. | Android proof or documented same-run reason showing stale/loading/unavailable states do not render as ready chart/depth/ticket placeholders. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-12 | P0 | No fallback/default/static-placeholder evidence may pass. | Proof rejects backend-only pass, static placeholders, default moneyline, first visible row, event-only ticket labels, generic Team to Advance, mock-ready rows, stale-as-ready status, and fallback depth. |
| EL-DEPTH-P0-13 | P0 | Agent B cannot pass without Android-visible proof. | Audit Gate entry lists Android visible proof as a blocker; backend JSON can support but cannot replace Agent B proof. |
| EL-DEPTH-P1-01 | P1 | Repeat the full depth path across at least two real provider-backed market families when available. | Android proof for Moneyline plus Spread/Totals/halves or documented provider unavailability. |
| EL-DEPTH-P1-02 | P1 | Fresh S23 ticket Buy/Sell reference should be recaptured when non-confirming access allows. | Same-cycle official Polymarket ticket screenshots/XML through Buy/Sell or side switch, stopping before deposit/location/confirmation. |
| EL-DEPTH-P1-03 | P1 | Book row tap should carry row price/side into ticket. | Android proof from a specific orderbook row to ticket showing selected price, side, shares/value context where supported. |
| EL-DEPTH-P1-04 | P1 | Player Props and lower sections should cover unavailable and available states. | Android proof for Player Props tab/section behavior and lower-page sections. |
| EL-DEPTH-P1-05 | P1 | Repeat live-section behavior with a current in-play event when available. | Android proof where live time/status changes while preserving selected market identity. |
| EL-DEPTH-P2-01 | P2 | Visual density, spacing, and hierarchy should feel close to the official app without copying brand assets. | Side-by-side review after P0 pass. |
| EL-DEPTH-P2-02 | P2 | Chart touch feel and Book row styling should be polished. | Visual QA for touch feedback, row bars, red/green or equivalent side styling, and scroll smoothness. |
| EL-DEPTH-P2-03 | P2 | Live chat preview and section transitions should feel native. | Device review for tab switching, chat preview updates, and return-to-game state. |

## Cycle EK-C Provider Transition Breadth Gate Criteria

The focused EK-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ek-c-provider-transition-gate.md` tracks the remaining route-backed provider-status transition breadth after EJ. EJ remains selected mixed-path regression coverage; EK is fail-until-integrated-proof for visible unavailable/not-ready, full transition, selected identity preservation, no fallback/default/generic behavior, and real-provider family breadth if available.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-01 | P0 | EK proof must be same-build and integrated across Agent A backend proof, Agent B Android proof, and Lead proof summary. | One committed EK bundle pairing backend route state with Android-visible markers for the same event and selected market identities. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-02 | P0 | Visible unavailable/not-ready state must be route-backed. | Backend route unavailable/empty/not-ready fields match Android-visible unavailable/not-ready labels, disabled or explicit Book/ticket behavior, and reason text for the same selected market. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-03 | P0 | Full stale or refresh-due -> refreshing/loading -> ready transition must be route-backed. | One selected market begins stale or refresh-due, triggers route-backed refresh, shows Android-visible refreshing/loading, and resolves ready with matching backend route fields. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-04 | P0 | Selected identity must be preserved across the whole transition. | Proof matrix maps event slug, market id or selector key, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, condition/token when available, chart status, Book/orderbook status, and ticket state before/during/after refresh. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-05 | P0 | Stale/refreshing/loading/ready states must not silently change the selected market. | Before/during/after Android XML and proof JSON show the same selected market identity, not a default moneyline, first row, generic market, event-only label, or generic Team to Advance target. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-06 | P0 | Book/orderbook must reflect selected route status honestly. | Ready cases show route-backed depth/source/status; non-ready cases show explicit loading/stale/unavailable state and no fallback depth counted as ready. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-07 | P0 | Ticket handoff must preserve selected identity or block honestly when not ready. | Ready tickets preserve selected identity and odds/price; stale/unavailable/not-ready tickets are disabled or explicit while preserving identity. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-08 | P0 | No fallback/default/generic market behavior may satisfy the gate. | Proof rejects fixture status source, mock-ready labels, backend-unreachable fallback, stale-as-ready labels, default moneyline, first-row, event-only, generic market, generic Team to Advance, fallback depth, source inspection, compile checks, and backend-only JSON. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-09 | P0 | Real-provider family breadth must be attempted and proven when available. | Lead includes real provider-backed family inventory. If two or more families are available, Android-visible proof covers Spread plus at least one of Totals, Moneyline, halves, team totals, corners, or props; otherwise Lead documents why breadth remains unavailable. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-10 | P0 | EJ selected proof remains regression evidence and cannot be used as the EK pass by substitution. | Lead summary separates EJ progress from EK pass evidence and names which EK P0 rows are newly proven. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P0-11 | P0 | Fresh S23 reference must not be claimed unless newly captured. | Audit notes, proof log, and Lead summary label DQ-C/S23 evidence stale/reference-only when reused. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P1-01 | P1 | Expand transition proof to every real provider-backed family exposed by current Polymarket data. | Additional transition/non-ready proof for Spread, Totals, Moneyline, halves, team totals, corners, and props when available. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P1-02 | P1 | Repeat the full transition for more than one provider-backed family. | At least two stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transitions with Android-visible route-backed markers. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P1-03 | P1 | Recapture fresh official Polymarket S23 reference evidence for the same status/interaction chain when access/location allows. | Same-cycle S23 screenshots/XML for live page, chart, Book/orderbook, selector/status states, and ticket/gated sheet. |
| EK-TRANSITION-P2-01 | P2 | Polish density, status language, chart touch feel, non-ready affordances, and Book/orderbook state styling. | Side-by-side review against fresh or reused Polymarket reference after P0 transition proof passes. |

## Cycle EJ-C Provider Status Breadth Gate Criteria

The focused EJ-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ej-c-provider-status-breadth-gate.md` tracks the remaining route-backed provider-status breadth after EI. EI remains a selected pass; EJ is fail-until-integrated-proof for breadth.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-01 | P0 | EJ proof must be same-build and integrated across Agent A backend proof, Agent B Android proof, and Lead proof summary. | One committed EJ bundle pairing backend route state with Android-visible markers for the same selected event/market identities. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-02 | P0 | Real provider-backed family breadth must be proven beyond the single EI disposable ready path. | Route-backed proof for at least two real provider-backed families when available, including Spread and one of Totals, Moneyline, halves, team totals, corners, or props. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-03 | P0 | Stale or refresh-due state must be route-backed and visible, not fixture-derived. | Backend route stale/refresh-due fields match Android-visible stale/refresh-due markers for the selected market with no silent conversion to ready. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-04 | P0 | Unavailable, empty, or not-ready state must be route-backed and visible. | Backend route unavailable/empty/not-ready fields match Android-visible state and messaging, with no default moneyline, first-row, or event-only fallback. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-05 | P0 | Full transition stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready must be proven route-backed. | One selected market begins stale or refresh-due, shows Android-visible refreshing/loading during route-backed refresh, and resolves ready with the same identity. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-06 | P0 | Selected identity must survive the whole breadth matrix. | Proof matrix maps event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, condition/token where available, status, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket state. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-07 | P0 | Book/orderbook state must match the route-backed selected status for ready and non-ready cases. | Ready cases show route-backed depth/source/status; non-ready cases show explicit loading/stale/unavailable state and no fallback depth counted as ready. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-08 | P0 | Ticket handoff must preserve route-backed selected status or block honestly when not ready. | Ready tickets preserve selected identity and odds/price; stale/unavailable/not-ready tickets are disabled or explicit while preserving identity. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-09 | P0 | Negative assertions must reject fallback and proof-only substitutes. | Proof rejects fixture status source, mock-ready labels, backend-unreachable fallback, stale-as-ready labels, default moneyline, first-row, event-only, fallback depth, backend-only JSON, source inspection, compile checks, and smoke logs without visible markers. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-10 | P0 | Fresh S23 reference must not be claimed unless newly captured. | Audit notes, proof log, and Lead summary label DQ-C/S23 evidence stale/reference-only when reused. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P0-11 | P0 | EI selected pass must stay regression coverage and must not be used as breadth proof. | Lead summary separates EI selected route-backed ready path from EJ breadth evidence. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P1-01 | P1 | Expand family breadth to every real provider-backed line family exposed by current Polymarket data. | Additional Spread, Totals, halves, team totals, corners, and props proof when available. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P1-02 | P1 | Recapture fresh official Polymarket S23 reference evidence for the same status/interaction chain when access/location allows. | Same-cycle S23 screenshots/XML for live page, chart, Book/orderbook, selector/status states, and ticket/gated sheet. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P1-03 | P1 | Repeat full transition proof across more than one provider-backed family. | At least two stale -> refreshing/loading -> ready transitions with Android-visible route-backed markers. |
| EJ-BREADTH-P2-01 | P2 | Polish density, status language, chart touch feel, non-ready affordances, and Book/orderbook state styling. | Side-by-side review against fresh or reused Polymarket reference after P0 breadth proof passes. |

## Cycle EI-C Route-Backed Provider Status Gate Criteria

The focused EI-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-ei-c-route-backed-status-gate.md` tracked the remaining PM-GAP-084 blocker after EH: tablet-visible provider lifecycle/status had to be sourced from the live backend route. Current status is pass for the selected EI integrated route-backed ready/Book/ticket path; broader status breadth moved to EJ.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-01 | P0 | Backend health and route reachability must be proven from the tablet launch context before visible status can count. | Same-run proof JSON records backend base URL, health/reachability result, live-detail/status route URL or route id, HTTP success, and no tablet-side backend unavailable condition. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-02 | P0 | Tablet XML and proof JSON must contain route-backed status markers, not only fixture-compatible labels. | Android XML/proof includes route/source/status/freshness/provider markers matched to backend route response fields for the selected market. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-03 | P0 | Ready status must be live-route-backed and tied to the selected market identity. | Backend ready fields match tablet-visible ready markers plus event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, and visible labels. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-04 | P0 | Stale or refresh-due status must be live-route-backed and tied to the same selected market identity. | Backend stale/refresh-due fields match tablet-visible stale/refresh-due markers without silent conversion to ready. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-05 | P0 | Refreshing or loading status must be live-route-backed and tied to the same selected market identity. | Backend refresh/loading state or documented refresh trigger is paired with tablet-visible loading/refreshing state while selected identity is preserved or explicitly disabled. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-06 | P0 | Unavailable, empty, or not-ready status must be live-route-backed and tied to the selected market identity. | Backend unavailable/not-ready fields match tablet-visible unavailable/not-ready state, with explicit messaging and no default ready ladder. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-07 | P0 | The same selected market identity must carry through live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket while preserving route-backed status context. | A proof matrix maps the same selected event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, and condition/token where available across every surface. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-08 | P0 | Book/orderbook ready depth or unavailable state must be tied to the same route-backed selected status. | Book/orderbook XML/proof shows selected market id or selector key, route-backed provider/status markers, Price/Shares/Value rows only when ready, explicit loading/unavailable states otherwise, side labels, spread when available, and no fallback rows counted as ready. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-09 | P0 | Ticket handoff must preserve the selected route-backed status context. | Ticket XML/proof shows matching event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, route-backed status marker, visible odds/price when ready, and disabled/loading/unavailable behavior when not ready. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-10 | P0 | Fixture, mock-ready, deterministic contract UI, default moneyline reconstruction, first-row fallback, and event-only labels must fail. | Proof-level assertions reject fixture status source, mock-ready labels, backend-unreachable tablet fallback, moneyline/default reconstruction, first visible row fallback, event-only labels, and stale labels counted as ready. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-11 | P0 | Backend-only route JSON is insufficient. | Backend proof may support the gate only when paired with matching Android-visible route-backed markers and selected market identity in the same proof bundle. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-12 | P0 | The EI proof must be same-build and cannot be replaced by prior EC/ED/EE/EF/EG/EH proof bundles. | Same-build proof matrix for the EI selected identity plus prior-gate regression references or rerun markers. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P0-13 | P0 | If stale S23 reference evidence is reused, the gate must state that limitation and cannot call it fresh same-cycle reference proof. | Audit notes name reused DQ-C/S23 evidence as stale/reference-only. |
| EI-ROUTE-STATUS-P1-01 | P1 | Repeat the route-backed status matrix across multiple real provider-backed line families. | Android proof for Spread, Totals, halves, and other visible families when available. |

## Cycle EH-C Provider Status Gate Criteria

The focused EH-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eh-c-provider-status-gate.md` tracks the remaining PM-GAP-084 blocker after EG: Android-visible provider lifecycle/status parity. Current status is partial after integrated Android proof; route-backed tablet status rendering remains open.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EH-STATUS-P0-01 | P0 | Same-cycle Holiwyn Android visible proof must exist for provider lifecycle/status on the exact live event detail feature. | Committed EH screenshots, XML, and proof JSON from one integrated Android run. |
| EH-STATUS-P0-02 | P0 | Ready state must be Android-visible and tied to the selected market identity. | Live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket proof showing ready provider/source/status plus the same event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, market id or selector key, and visible labels. |

| EH-STATUS-P0-07 | P0 | Generic fallback, fixture rows, mock-ready data, or default reconstructed status must fail. | Proof-level assertions and visible UI labels reject fallback/default reconstruction, including moneyline fallback, first-row fallback, event-only labels, stale labels counted as ready, and mock-ready provider rows. |
| EH-STATUS-P0-08 | P0 | Chart status must be tied to the selected market/outcome, not a generic chart placeholder. | Chart touch/context proof showing selected outcome or market context, provider/source/status, and no unintended navigation or ticket/Book side effect. |
| EH-STATUS-P0-09 | P0 | Book/orderbook status must be tied to the selected market identity when ready, stale, refreshing/loading, or unavailable/not-ready. | Book/orderbook proof showing selected market id or selector key, provider/status markers, Price/Shares/Value rows only when ready, explicit loading/unavailable states otherwise, side labels, spread when available, and no fallback rows counted as ready. |

## Cycle EG-C Live Event Visible Provider Gate Criteria

The focused EG-C gate in `docs/mobile/audits/cycle-eg-c-live-event-visible-provider-gate.md` opens PM-GAP-084 for structural live event detail parity and provider-backed visible behavior. Current status is fail until same-cycle integrated Android proof exists.

| ID | Priority | Criterion | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EG-LV-P0-01 | P0 | Same-cycle Holiwyn Android visible proof must exist for the exact live event detail feature. | Committed screenshots, XML, and proof JSON from an EG integrated Android run. |
| EG-LV-P0-02 | P0 | Backend-only proof is not sufficient. | Backend/provider fields must be paired to visible Android markers in the same selected flow; route JSON, compile checks, smoke logs, or source inspection cannot pass alone. |
| EG-LV-P0-03 | P0 | The live event page must visibly expose provider-backed ready, stale, refreshing, and unavailable/empty states honestly. | Android proof showing ready provider source/status and at least one stale/refreshing/unavailable state or a documented same-run reason it cannot be triggered. |
| EG-LV-P0-04 | P0 | Selected market identity must carry through live page, chart, Book/orderbook, and ticket. | One proof maps event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, condition/token where available, and visible labels across each surface. |
| EG-LV-P0-05 | P0 | Chart state must be tied to the selected market/outcome and status, not a generic placeholder. | Chart screenshot/XML/proof showing selected outcome or market context, provider/source/status, and no unintended ticket/book/share/chat/navigation side effect after chart touch. |
| EG-LV-P0-06 | P0 | Book/orderbook must render provider-backed visible depth for the same selected market identity when claiming ready status. | Android Book proof showing event identity, selected market id or selector key, provider/status markers, Price/Shares/Value rows, side labels, spread, and no fallback rows counted as ready. |
| EG-LV-P0-07 | P0 | Ticket handoff must preserve selected identity from the selected row/line/orderbook action. | Android ticket proof showing matching event, family/type, line, period, side/outcome, provider/source, market id or selector key, visible odds/price, and fake-token/test labeling if applicable. |
| EG-LV-P0-08 | P0 | Non-ready states must not silently fall back to moneyline, first visible row, event-only labels, or mock-ready rows. | Proof assertions and visible labels reject fallback/default reconstruction. |
| EG-LV-P0-09 | P0 | EC/ED/EE/EF regression markers must remain intact but cannot substitute for EG. | Same-build non-regression references or rerun markers for prior selected gates, plus separate EG live-event visible provider proof. |
| EG-LV-P0-10 | P0 | If stale S23 reference evidence is reused, the gate must state that limitation and cannot call it fresh same-cycle reference proof. | Audit notes name reused DQ-C/S23 evidence as stale/reference-only. |
| EG-LV-P1-01 | P1 | Repeat the integrated visible provider proof across multiple real provider-backed line families. | Android proof for Spread, Totals, halves, and other visible families when available. |
| EG-LV-P1-02 | P1 | Recapture fresh official Polymarket S23 reference evidence for the same live event and interaction chain when access/location allows. | Same-cycle S23 screenshots/XML for live page, chart, Book, selector, and ticket/gated sheet. |
| EG-LV-P1-03 | P1 | Prove provider refresh changing stale -> refreshing -> ready without losing selected market identity. | Android-visible refresh lifecycle plus backend proof for the same selected identity. |
| EG-LV-P2-01 | P2 | Polish live-page density, chart touch feel, orderbook row styling, and status messaging after P0 identity/status proof passes. | Side-by-side visual review against fresh or reused Polymarket reference. |
