If missing, the banner is omitted. | No new backend support is missing for the banner. Real provider-backed line markets remain missing for the current event and are tracked separately. |

## Cycle MK - Provider Line Readiness Inspection

Cycle MK re-checks Polymarket Gamma candidate availability for the current Local MVP event.

Existing Local MVP line rows are backend-shaped `contract-fixture` markets. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total markets are not attached for the inspected event. |

## Cycle LH - Event Detail Dead Live Stats Contract

Cycle LH removes the unreachable fake live stats panel, deterministic sports-stat rows, and match-flow timeline from Event Detail source. Event Detail still consumes backend route-status metadata for hidden proof markers while the MVP excludes a visible live-stat product surface.

- Event Detail dead live stats proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LH-event-detail-dead-live-stats-contract/cycle-LH-event-detail-dead-live-stats-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_event_detail_dead_live_stats_contract.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail MVP route-status markers | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, `/api/events/:slug/markets`, `/api/markets/:id/quote` | GET | Public event viewing; account/order auth only for user state and trading actions | Existing route params/query only | Event identity, teams, status/time, backend market profile/rules, compact markets, primary outcomes, Game Lines, provider/live availability metadata for hidden proof markers | Existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider lifecycle/status read models | Offline/mock mode can still use local event fixtures, but Event Detail no longer contains fake live-stat rows or a match-flow timeline. | Real route-backed sports/live stats remain outside MVP unless a visible live-stat product surface is explicitly scoped. |

## Cycle LG - Home Card Stats Contract

Cycle LG removes hidden local-MVP volume/liquidity stats from active Home match cards. Home cards remain tied to the `/api/events` feed in server mode and use backend-provided event rules/profile fields for outcome selection.

- Home card stats proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LG-home-card-stats-contract/cycle-LG-home-card-stats-contract.json`.

Inactive Futures catalog presentation still carries local volume/chart fallback and remains a tracked P1 only if restored to visible MVP. |

## Cycle LF - Event Detail No Chat/Stats Contract

Cycle LF removes leftover Event Detail chat UI code and frontend-invented volume/liquidity/trader stats. Event Detail remains focused on route-backed event identity, primary outcomes, user position, Game Lines, Player Props placeholder, and backend market summary metadata.

- Event Detail no chat/stats proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LF-event-detail-no-chat-stats-contract/cycle-LF-event-detail-no-chat-stats-contract.json`.

## Cycle LE - Search Result Stats Contract

Cycle LE removes frontend-invented Search result stats. Search rows no longer display fake volume, liquidity, today-volume, or chat counts; they keep event identity/start time/top outcome/save/navigation backed by the existing Search route and profile preference sync.

- Search result stats proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LE-search-result-stats-contract/cycle-LE-search-result-stats-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_search_result_stats_contract.ts`.

## Cycle LD - Portfolio Settings Contract

Cycle LD removes the duplicate local-only Portfolio account/settings gear and sheet. Portfolio remains focused on route-backed account value, positions, orders, history, cashout, buy, and cancel controls; Account remains the owner of account/preferences surfaces.

- Portfolio settings proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LD-portfolio-settings-contract/cycle-LD-portfolio-settings-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_portfolio_settings_contract.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/portfolioSettingsContract.test.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Portfolio account/settings affordance | Existing Portfolio routes only: `/api/account/balance`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history`, `/api/portfolio/value-history`, plus existing Account preference/profile routes on the Account surface | GET for Portfolio data; Account uses its already-documented GET/PUT preference/summary routes | Existing account read/write auth when server mode is active | None for removed Portfolio settings sheet | Portfolio consumes balance, value-history, positions, open orders, history/activity, cashout/cancel state | Existing account balance, portfolio, order, position, trade/history, and profile preference models already documented by KT/KP/KU/KW | Mock/offline mode keeps Portfolio data fallback only. It no longer exposes a duplicate local-only account settings sheet. | Broader account/security/session/funding settings remain future Account-surface work only if MVP scope expands. |

## Cycle LC - Account Static Rows Contract

Cycle LC removes unsupported hardcoded Account rows (`Theme: Dark`, security teaser, fake-token static row). Account keeps rows backed by profile preferences, profile summary, or app trading-mode state.

- Account static rows proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LC-account-static-rows-contract/cycle-LC-account-static-rows-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_account_static_rows_contract.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Account settings/status rows | Existing `/api/profile/preferences`, `/api/profile/summary`, and local trading mode state | GET/PUT for preferences; GET for summary | Existing account preference/profile auth when server mode is active | Existing preference body only | Locale, saved market count, portfolio/account summary values, ticket defaults, profile sync status, trading mode | Existing `UserProfilePreference`, account summary read models | Mock/offline mode keeps local preference and trading-mode display only. Unsupported static rows are not shown. | Theme/security settings require future backend contracts before they become visible. |

## Cycle LB - Account Auth Visibility Contract

Cycle LB removes local mock Account login/signup/sign-out actions. Visible Account auth state is now display-only and route-derived: server profile summary success marks the Account screen as signed in; otherwise auth actions are unavailable.

- Account auth visibility proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LB-account-auth-visibility-contract/cycle-LB-account-auth-visibility-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_account_auth_visibility_contract.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Account auth state | `/api/profile/summary` through existing Account summary wiring | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read`; route id `account:summary` | None | Successful summary load sets app-level `forceAccountSignedIn=true`; summary props drive visible profile/account values | Existing `User`, `UserProfilePreference`, `UserBalance`, `Position`, `Order` route read models | Mock/offline mode shows signed-out/auth-unavailable copy only. It no longer stores or toggles a local fake auth session. | Full login, signup, logout, session, KYC, and wallet auth flows remain outside focused MVP scope. |

## Cycle LA - Header Actions Contract

Cycle LA removes unsupported local-only promo and notification actions from the app header. The remaining visible header action is language switching, which is already covered by the profile preference/local preference path:

- Header actions proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-LA-header-actions-contract/cycle-LA-header-actions-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_header_actions_contract.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible app header actions | Existing language preference path through local app state and `/api/profile/preferences` when server preferences are active | GET/PUT for preferences; no route for removed actions | Existing account preference auth when server mode is active | Existing preference body only | Locale/language state only | Existing `UserProfilePreference.preferences` for server preference sync | Mock/offline mode keeps local language switching. Promo and notification actions are not shown and do not invent local fake feedback. | Promo/rewards/claim-credit and notifications routes remain outside focused MVP scope. Add them only if product scope expands. |

## Cycle KZ - Search Controls Route Contract

Cycle KZ removes unsupported local-only Search category/sort controls so the visible Search page only exposes controls backed by the current route contract:

- Search controls proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KZ-search-controls-route-contract/cycle-KZ-search-controls-route-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_search_controls_contract.ts`.

Unsupported local category chips and local sort buttons are not visible in the focused MVP Search surface. |

## Cycle KY - Account Menu Availability Wiring

Cycle KY wires visible Account More-menu rows to explicit backend availability metadata instead of leaving outside-MVP rows as tappable dead buttons:

- Account menu availability proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KY-account-menu-availability-wiring/cycle-KY-account-menu-availability-wiring.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_account_menu_availability_wiring.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Account More-menu availability | `/api/profile/summary` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read`; route id `account:summary` | None | `menuItems[].key`, `menuItems[].status=unavailable`, `menuItems[].reason=outside-mvp-scope`, `menuItems[].route=null` | No new table; static MVP availability metadata is returned alongside existing profile summary data | Mock/offline mode uses the same unavailable metadata fallback and renders non-actionable rows. | Real routes for leaderboard, rewards, API management, accuracy, status, documentation, help, and terms only if MVP scope expands. |

## Cycle KX - Route Wiring Tracker Consolidation

Cycle KX reconciles stale documentation rows after the KJ-KW UI wiring passes:

- Tracker proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KX-route-wiring-tracker-consolidation/cycle-KX-route-wiring-tracker-consolidation.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_route_wiring_tracker_consolidation.ts`.

Cycle KX only removes stale tracker statements that contradicted later closure cycles. | Repeat tracker sweep after the next backend/UI wiring batch. |

## Cycle KW - Profile Preferences UI Sync Wiring

Cycle KW wires the visible Account/preference state to the already-proven profile preferences route in server mode:

- Profile preferences UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KW-profile-preferences-ui-sync-wiring/cycle-KW-profile-preferences-ui-sync-wiring.json`.

| Visible preference load | `/api/profile/preferences` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read` | None | `preferences.locale`, `ticketDefaultAmount`, `ticketDefaultSide`, `ticketDefaultSlippage`, `savedEventIds[]` | Existing `UserProfilePreference.preferences` JSON | Mock/offline mode keeps AsyncStorage-local locale, saved markets, and ticket defaults. Server mode waits for local hydration, then applies successful route preferences to visible app state. | Broader account/security/session/funding settings remain outside focused MVP scope. |
| Visible preference save | `/api/profile/preferences` | PUT | Canonical actor with `account:write` | `locale`, `ticketDefaultAmount`, `ticketDefaultSide`, `ticketDefaultSlippage`, `savedEventIds[]` | Normalized saved preference response and visible sync status | Same existing preferences row | Server-mode route failure sets visible sync error; mock mode does not call the route. | Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again. |
| Account preference display | Same route through app state and `/api/profile/summary` fallback props | GET | Same account actor | None | Account language row, saved market count, ticket default row, and profile sync status | `UserProfilePreference`, plus summary route existing Account values | Non-server Account props remain local/demo by design. | None for focused visible preference fields. |

## Cycle KV - Home Filter UI Route Wiring

Cycle KV wires the visible Home filter chips to the already-proven backend status-filter event route in server market-data mode:

- Home filter UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KV-home-filter-ui-route-wiring/cycle-KV-home-filter-ui-route-wiring.json`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Home filtered event page | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&status=<home-filter>&limit=10` | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params only | `events[]`, compact `markets[]`, event `status`, `nextCursor`, `page.hasMore` | Existing `Event`, public listed `Market`, active `Outcome` rows | In mock/offline mode Home still filters local events by status. In server market-data mode backend filtered route pages drive the visible Home list. | Calendar-accurate `today` date-window semantics only if product later wants date-window filtering instead of status filtering. |
| Visible Home load more for selected filter | Same `/api/events` route with `cursor=<event-id>` | GET | Public/mobile route | Cursor query param | Next filtered route page, cursor metadata, loading state | Same existing tables and cursor ordering as Home route contracts | Failed server loads fall back only through the service route-unavailable path; successful server pages are not locally replaced. | Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again. |

## Cycle KS - Event Detail Line Options UI Wiring

Cycle KS wires the visible Event Detail/Game Lines line and period chips to the already-proven backend-backed line options service:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Event Detail/Game Lines line chips | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and `/api/events/:slug/markets` through selected event `markets[]` | GET | Public/mobile routes; auth header tolerated but not required | Event slug path param | `markets[].marketType`, `markets[].period`, `markets[].line`, `markets[].outcomes[]`, selected market ids, outcome ids, and availability metadata | Existing `Event`, public listed `Market`, active `Outcome`, optional quote/read-model rows | Mock/offline mode uses whatever fixture markets are on the selected event. Server mode treats successful route/catalog `markets[]` as authoritative; missing backend lines do not create visible chips. | Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; production real-provider breadth remains under provider lanes. |

## Cycle KR - Portfolio Cancel UI Wiring

Cycle KR proves the visible Portfolio cancel button is wired to the already-proven backend cancel route in server mode:

| Visible Portfolio open-order cancel | `/api/orders/:id` | DELETE | Canonical actor with `orders:write`; route scopes order lookup to actor user id | Order id path param only | Cancel response, then refreshed `/api/portfolio` open orders and `/api/portfolio/history` canceled activity | `Order`, `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `UserBalance`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mock mode keeps local cancel behavior. Server mode calls `cancelOpenOrderOnServer()` -> `PolyApi.cancelOrder()` and refreshes Portfolio from backend state. | Broader provider-family cancel breadth remains future hardening if gates require it. |

## Cycle KQ - Trade Ticket Submit UI Wiring

Cycle KQ proves the visible Trade Ticket submit control is wired to the already-proven backend order route in server mode:

- Trade Ticket submit UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KQ-trade-ticket-submit-ui-wiring/cycle-KQ-trade-ticket-submit-ui-wiring.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_trade_ticket_submit_ui_wiring.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Trade Ticket submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical actor with `orders:write`; internal trading beta gate and provider tradability guard remain enforced server-side | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `contractSide`, `price`, `size`, and normalized `selection` from the visible ticket | `order.id`, `order.status`, `order.size`, `order.remaining`, `fills[]`; Portfolio refresh then consumes `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `UserBalance`, Portfolio read models | Mock mode keeps local fake-token orders. Server mode calls `submitTicketOrder()` -> `PolyApi.placeLimitOrder()` -> `/api/orders`; route failure surfaces ticket error and does not create local fake server orders. | Broader provider-family submit breadth remains future hardening if gates require it. |

## Cycle KP - Portfolio Sync UI Wiring

Cycle KP proves the visible Portfolio screen consumes the already-proven backend Portfolio snapshot/history sync in server mode:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Portfolio sync | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read`; route ids covered by existing portfolio route contracts | None | Snapshot balance, positions, open orders, selection metadata, recent trades, canceled activities/history, and sync status | Existing `UserBalance`, `Position`, `Order`, `Trade`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | In server mode route success drives visible `Portfolio` props. Partial route failure preserves the last known local half only for the failed route. Full route failure sets sync error instead of inventing mock rows. | Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; broader provider lifecycle breadth remains under provider lanes. |
| Portfolio refresh after server mutations | Same `/api/portfolio` plus `/api/portfolio/history` routes | GET after server order submit, cancel, and position close/cashout | Same active mobile API key/session auth | None | Fresh route-backed visible positions/open orders/history after mutation | Same existing Portfolio and order lifecycle tables | Mock/offline order mode keeps existing local state path. Server mode refreshes from backend after successful mutation. | Filled/cancel breadth for more provider families remains future hardening. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Trade Ticket quote refresh | `/api/markets/:id/quote?outcomeId=:outcomeId` | GET | Public/mobile route; auth header tolerated but not required | Market id path param, optional outcome id query param | `quotes[]`, selected `outcomeId`, `outcomeName`, `bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `bestBidSize`, `bestAskSize`, `midPrice`, `lastPrice` mapped into visible ticket odds/quote fields | Existing `Market`, active `Outcome`, orderbook depth/read-model rows, latest trade price when available | Server route failure keeps the current ticket state. Mock/offline mode keeps local ticket odds. Selected limit-price tickets do not overwrite the explicit staged limit price. | Optional Android proof if visual proof becomes required again; production provider quote breadth remains under provider lanes. |
| Visible Event Detail quote refresh | Same `/api/markets/:id/quote` route through `loadMarketQuotesById()` | GET | Public/mobile route | Market ids from selected event markets | Backend quote fields update visible market/outcome probabilities and bid/ask fields before ticket opening | Same existing market/outcome/orderbook read models | Server route failure leaves selected event markets unchanged instead of inventing quote rows. | Broader provider quote freshness remains under provider refresh lanes. |

- Focused backend tests: `src/__tests__/orders.internal-trading-gate.route.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trade Ticket server submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical actor with `orders:write`; internal trading beta gate must pass before order submission | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type=LIMIT`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, `clientOrderId`, `selection`; `Idempotency-Key` header | `order.id`, `order.status`, `order.size`, `order.remaining`, `fills[]`; mobile result preserves selection and status | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `UserBalance` | Mock mode still creates local fake-token orders. Server mode must call the route through `PolyApi.placeLimitOrder()`. Cycle KQ proves visible Trade Ticket submit uses this route. | P1: broader provider-family submit breadth if future gates require it. |
| Portfolio open order after submit | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[]` including `selection` market/outcome/line/period/provider token fields | `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ApiOrderRequest` selection snapshot | Local UI fallback must not replace server-mode open order hydration. | P1: broader provider-family submit breadth if future gates require it. |

## Cycle JZ - Open Order Cancel Route Contract

Cycle JZ proves the visible Portfolio open-order cancel dependency without editing dirty Portfolio UI files:

- Cancel route proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JZ-open-order-cancel-route-contract/cycle-JZ-open-order-cancel-route-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_open_order_cancel_route_contract.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/openOrderService.test.ts`.
- Focused backend tests: `src/__tests__/orders.cancel.route.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio open-order cancel | `/api/orders/:id` | DELETE | Canonical actor with `orders:write`; route scopes order lookup to actor user id | Order id path param only | `order.id`, `order.status=CANCELED`, `type`, `clientOrderId`, `apiKeyId`, `canceledByApiKeyId`, `balance`, `position` | `Order`, `Market`, `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `UserBalance`, `Position` | Mock mode does not call backend cancel. Server mode must call the route. Cycle KR proves the visible Portfolio cancel control uses this route. | P1: broader family breadth if future provider gates require it. |
| Portfolio refresh after cancel | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read` | None | Open orders after cancel; `canceledOrders[]` with `selection` identity; mobile activity mapping preserves market/outcome/line/period/provider token fields | `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ApiOrderRequest` selection snapshots | Local canceled activity helper can update optimistic UI but does not replace server refresh proof. | P1: broader family breadth if future provider gates require it. |

## Cycle JY - Portfolio Value History Service Contract

Cycle JY adds a focused mobile service-layer loader for the backend Portfolio value-history route without editing dirty Portfolio UI files:

- Focused backend tests: `src/__tests__/portfolio.value-history.route.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio value history service load | `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=1D|1W|1M|All` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | Query params only | `range`, `ranges`, `source`, `status`, `generatedAt`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `points[].timestamp/value/cash/positionsValue/pnl` | Existing `UserBalance`, `Position`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` route inputs | `loadPortfolioValueHistory()` uses deterministic backend-shaped data only when the API client is absent or route loading fails. It preserves the route payload when available. | Cycle KU wires visible Portfolio chart to this service in server mode. |

## Cycle KU - Portfolio Value History UI Wiring

Cycle KU wires the visible Portfolio performance chart to the value-history service in server mode:

- UI proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-KU-portfolio-value-history-ui-wiring/cycle-KU-portfolio-value-history-ui-wiring.json`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio performance chart | `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=<range>` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | Query param `range` | `source`, `status`, `range`, `points[]`, timestamps, empty state | Existing `UserBalance`, `Position`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` route inputs | Mock mode uses deterministic backend-shaped fallback. Server mode uses `loadPortfolioValueHistory()` and falls back only when route loading fails. | Persisted account-level value snapshots remain future hardening; current route reconstructs from wallet, positions, and market snapshots. |
| Portfolio range selector | Same route with `range=1D|1W|1M|All` | GET | Same actor | Query param `range` | Route result for the active range; visible proof markers include `portfolio-chart-source-*`, `portfolio-chart-status-*`, and point count | Same as above | Same as above | Optional Android proof if visual/device proof becomes required again. |

## Cycle JX - Line Options Contract

Cycle JX adds a focused mobile service contract for backend-backed line/period availability:

- Line options proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JX-line-options-contract/cycle-JX-line-options-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_line_options_contract.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Game Lines line/period options | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and compact `events[].markets[]` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug or list query | `markets[].marketType`, `markets[].period`, `markets[].line`, `markets[].outcomes[]` | Existing `Market.marketType`, `Market.period`, `Market.line`, active `Outcome` rows | Service returns empty options when backend lacks a line/period. It does not invent choices. | Cycle KS wires visible Event Detail/Game Lines chips to the service; optional Android proof remains only if visual proof becomes required again. |
| Provider market type aliases | Same market payloads | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug or list query | `marketType=total_goals/team_total_goals` mapped to totals/team-total families | Existing provider-ingested market rows | Alias handling only maps provided backend rows; it does not create rows. | P1: broader provider-backed family coverage when available. |

## Cycle JW - Portfolio Activity Mapper Contract

Cycle JW tightens the mobile service-layer route contract for visible Portfolio positions and history without redesigning Portfolio:

- Mapper proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JW-portfolio-activity-mapper-contract/cycle-JW-portfolio-activity-mapper-contract.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_portfolio_activity_mapper_contract.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/portfolioHistoryService.test.ts` and `mobile/src/__tests__/portfolioSnapshotService.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio positions | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `positions[].selection.marketType=to_advance`, market/outcome ids, display label, period, side, provider source, external market id, condition id, reference token id, reference outcome label | `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ApiOrderRequest` selection snapshots | If backend selection is absent, legacy title/outcome fallback remains but is not accepted as JW proof. | P1: UI-level proof once dirty Portfolio screen churn is reconciled. |
| Portfolio recent activity/history | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `recentTrades[].orderId`, `selection`, market/outcome ids, cost, shares, createdAt; grouped into one row with `fillCount` when fills share an order or execution window | `Trade`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, order request selection snapshots | Recent trades without order ids can still group by equivalent selection fields and execution window. | P1: broader real-provider lifecycle repetition across more market families. |

## Cycle JV - Mobile API Route Contract Backfill

Cycle JV consolidates mobile client/type definitions required by already-gated backend routes without touching dirty UI files:

- Route/client proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JV-mobile-api-route-contract-backfill/cycle-JV-mobile-api-route-contract-backfill.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_api_route_contract_backfill.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/api.test.ts`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home/Search event pages | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=<n>&cursor=<event-id>&search=<query>` | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params only | `events[]`, `nextCursor`, `page.limit`, `page.nextCursor`, `page.hasMore`, compact `events[].markets[]` | Existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Cycle KJ wires visible Search pagination, and Cycle KV wires visible Home filters plus active-filter pagination to backend pages in server mode. | Calendar/date-window filtering only if product later changes the `Today` chip semantics. |
| Event rule fields on summaries | Same `/api/events` route and event detail routes | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params or event slug | `marketProfile`, `resultMode`, `gameRules`, `supportedMarketTypes` | Existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mobile fallback derivation remains only a fallback when backend fields are absent. | P1: broader real-provider replay for more event profiles. |
| Portfolio value history client | `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=1D|1W|1M|All` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | Query params only | `range`, `ranges`, `source`, `status`, `generatedAt`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `points[]` | `UserBalance`, `Position`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Standalone/mock mode still uses deterministic fallback; server mode passes a service-backed loader to Portfolio. | Cycle KU closes visible Portfolio chart server-mode loader wiring. |

## Cycle JU - Profile Preferences Route Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account/settings preference load | `/api/profile/preferences` | GET | Canonical actor with `account:read` | None | `preferences.locale`, `ticketDefaultAmount`, `ticketDefaultSide`, `ticketDefaultSlippage`, `savedEventIds` | `UserProfilePreference.preferences` JSON payload keyed by user | Local app preferences remain the non-server-mode fallback. | P1: full account/settings shell contract for profile identity, auth/session, notifications, wallet controls, and security settings. |
| Account/settings preference save | `/api/profile/preferences` | PUT | Canonical actor with `account:write` | Canonical `ProfilePreferences` payload | Saved canonical preferences, mapped back to local mobile side/slippage/default amount state | `UserProfilePreference` upsert via existing service | Mobile mapper defaults legacy missing slippage to `1%`; invalid canonical payloads are rejected before storage. Server-mode visible UI sync is covered by Cycle KW. | Broader account/settings shell only if visible MVP scope expands. |

## Cycle JT - Search Event Route Contract

Cycle JT tightens backend search for the visible mobile Search tab without touching currently dirty mobile UI files:

- Route proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JT-search-event-route-contract/cycle-JT-search-event-route-contract.json`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search result route data | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&search=<query>&limit=<n>&cursor=<event-id>` | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params only | `events[]`, compact `events[].markets[]`, `nextCursor`, `page.limit`, `page.nextCursor`, `page.hasMore` | Existing `Event`, listed public `Market`, active `Outcome` rows | Cycle KJ wires the visible Search tab to backend result pages in server mode. Local filtering remains non-server/route-unavailable fallback only. | P1: ranked/faceted search and localized aliases for production-scale discovery. |
| Backend search matching | Same `/api/events` route | GET | Public/mobile route | Search query | Query matches event title/description, home/away team names, listed public market title/description, and outcome `name`/`label` | `Event.homeTeamName`, `Event.awayTeamName`, `Market.title`, `Market.description`, `Outcome.name`, `Outcome.label` | No frontend-only result invention in the route proof. | P1: ranked/faceted search and localized aliases for production-scale discovery. |

## Cycle JS - Cashout Route Sell Safety

Cycle JS hardens and proves the server-mode cashout/sell route contract for the visible Portfolio cashout flow:

- Route/service proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JS-cashout-route-sell-safety/cycle-JS-cashout-route-sell-safety.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_cashout_route_sell_safety.ts`.
- Focused backend tests: `src/server/services/__tests__/canonical_order_submission.phase5.test.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/positionCloseService.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio full-position cashout / sell | Canonical order submission backing `/api/orders` | POST | Existing canonical API key/session order auth; proof uses the route service directly to avoid external auth harness noise | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side=SELL`, `type=LIMIT`, finite full-position `size`, and current close `price` | Success: `order.id/status/side/size/remaining`, `position.shares/reservedShares`. Failure: `error.code=INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, clear insufficient-share message, `responseStatus=409` stored on `ApiOrderRequest` | Existing `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `UserBalance`; valid proof shares come from complete-set minting so collateral invariants remain intact | Server mode does not fall back to mock cashout. Mobile blocks zero, missing, and non-finite shares before submit. | P1: optional full external HTTP auth-stack smoke for `POST /api/orders`; canonical route submission and stored response shape are proven. |

## Cycle JR - Home Event List and Pagination

Cycle JR wires the visible Home event list "Load more" flow to backend cursor pagination in server market-data mode:

- Route proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JR-home-event-list-pagination/cycle-JR-home-event-pagination.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_home_event_pagination.ts`.
- Focused route tests: selected cases in `src/__tests__/public.events.no-leak.test.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/api.test.ts` and `mobile/src/__tests__/homePaginationService.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home event list initial page | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params only | `events[]` with compact `markets[]`, plus `nextCursor` and `page.hasMore` | Existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` rows; listed public markets only | In mock market-data mode Home still uses local fixture pagination. In server mode the initial Home list comes from the backend page, and Cycle KV wires visible Home filter chips to the route. | P1: calendar/date-window filtering only if product changes the `Today` chip semantics. |
| Home "Load more" | `/api/events?...&limit=10&cursor=<event-id>` | GET | Public/mobile route | Query params only | Next `events[]` page, `nextCursor`, `page.limit`, `page.hasMore` | Cursor resolves against `Event.id` and stable route ordering by `updatedAt`, `createdAt`, `id` descending | Failed next-page loads do not replace loaded server events with local mocks. | P1: Android device proof for pressing Load more in server mode if visual regression evidence becomes required again. |

## Cycle JQ - Backend-Driven Event Rules and Sell Safety

Cycle JQ tightens backend-owned market-rule contracts for visible Event Detail/Game Lines UI and verifies sell/cashout safety:

- Route proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-JQ-backend-event-market-cashout-safety/cycle-JQ-market-rule-profiles.json`.
- Focused backend tests: `src/__tests__/mobile-event-market-rules-contract.test.ts` and selected sell-safety cases in `src/server/services/__tests__/phase7_kalshi_model.test.ts`.
- Focused mobile tests: `mobile/src/__tests__/worldCupAdapter.test.ts` and `mobile/src/__tests__/positionCloseService.test.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail/Game Lines market-rule rendering | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and event summary serialization | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | `event.marketProfile`, `event.resultMode`, `event.gameRules.allowDraw`, `event.gameRules.includesOvertime`, `event.supportedMarketTypes`, plus backend markets/outcomes/period/line/type | Existing `Event`, `Market`, and `Outcome` fields: `sportKey`, `leagueKey`, `eventType`, `description`, `marketType`, `marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupTitle`, `period`, `line`, outcomes with `side/label/name` | Mobile preserves backend-provided rule fields first. Local derivation is fallback only and now uses the same explicit `to_advance`/`to_qualify` key detection instead of guessing from event/team names. | P1: production real-provider replay across more World Cup event profiles. No new schema migration required for this cycle. |
| Regulation draw versus knockout advance profile | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | Regulation profile returns `marketProfile=regulation_90`, `resultMode=can_draw`, `supportedMarketTypes` containing `regulation_90`, `spread`, `totals`. Knockout profile returns `marketProfile=full_match_with_overtime`, `resultMode=can_draw`, and supports both separate `to_advance` and `regulation_90`. | Same existing event/market/outcome tables | No frontend-invented market rows are accepted by the proof. Backend availability determines which market groups are present. | P1: broader provider-backed family availability beyond disposable contract proof rows. |
| Cashout/sell safety | Canonical order submission backing `POST /api/orders`; mobile `closePositionOnServer()` submits a full-position `SELL` | POST | Existing canonical API key/session order auth | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side=SELL`, `type=LIMIT`, full `size` from position shares, price from current/best price, `selection` identity | Backend rejects no-position and oversell attempts; mobile blocks no-share and oversize sell attempts before submit. Valid sell within available position can proceed. | Existing `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | No mock fallback may permit server-mode naked sells. Local fake-token UI remains test-only and must keep the same safety checks. | P1: full HTTP route proof under production-like auth flags; current focused proof exercises canonical backend service and mobile service guards. |

## Cycle ET - Period-Safe Retail Line Matching

Cycle ET changes mobile route-data selection rules, not backend schema/routes:

- Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ET-local-mvp-period-safe-line-family/cycle-ES-local-mvp-line-family-breadth-proof.json`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-backed retail line ticket matching | Existing `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` data when in server mode; local proof uses fixture fallback | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | Mobile requires each backend line market to expose `marketType`, `line`, `period`, outcomes, provider ids/tokens, and availability so the selected retail ticket can match family + line + period | Existing `Market.period`, `Market.line`, `Market.marketType`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, provider snapshot tables | If backend family/line/period does not match, mobile falls back to deterministic contract-shaped fixture instead of using wrong route data | P1: route proof with real provider-backed spread/totals/team-total rows through the simple ticket path. |

## Cycle ES - Local MVP Line-Family Ticket Breadth

Cycle ES changes mobile contract-shaped fallback coverage and Android proof, not backend schema/routes:

- Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ES-local-mvp-line-family-breadth/cycle-ES-local-mvp-line-family-breadth-proof.json`.
- Visible Book/orderbook controls remain hidden by default and debug/internal via `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_ORDERBOOK=1`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default Local MVP Totals and Team Total tickets | No new endpoint; proof exercises existing mobile fake-token ticket state and line-ticket resolver | N/A for ES proof | N/A for ES proof | N/A until submit; ticket opens with selected market family/type, line, period, display label, and contract side | Mobile consumes line-family ticket fields for `totals` and `team-total`, including `ticket-line`, `ticket-period`, `ticket-display-label`, and outcome identity | Future backend route should provide provider-backed `Market`/`Outcome` rows for spread/totals/team-total with `marketType`, `line`, `period`, provider ids/tokens, availability, and price fields | Deterministic Team Total fallback is contract-shaped and used only when backend team-total line market is absent | P1: replace deterministic Team Total fallback with real Polymarket-backed route data where available, or explicit unavailable/stale route status where Polymarket does not expose that market. |

## Cycle ER - Local MVP Retail Status Flow

Cycle ER changes proof coverage, not backend schema/routes:

- Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ER-local-mvp-status-flow/cycle-ER-local-mvp-status-flow-proof.json`.
- Visible Book/orderbook controls remain hidden by default and debug/internal via `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_ORDERBOOK=1`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default local MVP retail status surface | No new endpoint; proof exercises existing mobile event-detail fallback/status state | N/A for ER proof | N/A for ER proof | N/A | Mobile renders chart route status, ticket handoff provider lifecycle, selected line identity, and hidden orderbook state markers | Future provider-backed route should continue using `Event.liveDataStatus`, `Market.availability`, chart history status/source, and selected market/outcome identity fields | Deterministic line/status fixture is accepted only for local UI proof | P1: route-backed loading/stale/unavailable status breadth for provider-backed retail tickets, without requiring users to open Book. |

## Cycle EQ - Local MVP Sell Flow

Cycle EQ changes mobile ticket identity and proof coverage, not backend schema/routes:

- Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EQ-local-mvp-sell-flow/cycle-EQ-local-mvp-trade-flow-proof.json`.
- Visible Book/orderbook controls remain hidden by default and debug/internal via `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_ORDERBOOK=1`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default local MVP simple Sell ticket | No new endpoint; fixture proof exercises existing mobile fake-token trading state and selected-ticket/portfolio mappers | N/A for EQ proof | N/A for EQ proof | Ticket submit uses existing fake-token order shape with selected spread line identity, `side=sell`, and `contractSide=no` | Mobile consumes the same selection envelope in ticket, latest order, activity, and position rows: market family/type, line, period, side, contract side, display label, order status, and fake-token activity text | Future backend route remains existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `Order`, `Position`, `Trade`, and selection snapshot fields; no new schema | Deterministic line fixture is accepted only for local UI proof and is shaped like backend selection data, not arbitrary display-only strings | P1: repeat Buy/Sell simple-ticket flow with real provider-backed spreads, totals, and team totals. Production backend order route should preserve the same `side` plus `contractSide` envelope into portfolio/history. |

## Cycle EP - Local MVP Trade Flow Steering

Cycle EP changes the default mobile surface, not backend schema/routes:

- Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EP-local-mvp-trade-flow/cycle-EP-local-mvp-trade-flow-proof.json`.
- Visible Book/orderbook controls are hidden by default and remain debug/internal via `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_ORDERBOOK=1`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default local MVP event detail and simple ticket | No new endpoint; fixture proof exercises existing mobile mock trading state and existing selected-ticket/portfolio mappers | N/A for EP proof | N/A for EP proof | Ticket submit uses existing mobile fake-token order shape with selected `marketId`/`outcomeId` where available, market family/type, line, period, side, contract side, probability/price, and display label | Mobile consumes the same selection envelope in ticket, latest order, activity, and position rows | Future backend route remains existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `Order`, `Position`, `Trade`, and selection snapshot fields; no new schema | Deterministic line fixture is accepted only for UI proof and is shaped like backend selection data, not arbitrary display-only strings | P1: repeat the same simple-ticket flow with real provider-backed spread/totals/team-total routes and Sell-side order/portfolio history. Loading/stale/unavailable states should stay visible in the retail flow without forcing Book. |

## Cycle EO-A - Route-Backed Lifecycle Breadth

- Backend proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EO-A-route-breadth/proof.json`.
- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_eo_a_route_breadth.ts`.

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Totals provider-depth Sell selection source | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET / GET | Public/mobile routes | Event slug and selected market id | Live-detail `markets[].selection`, `markets[].outcomes[]`, `markets[].orderbookDepth[]`, `orderbookIdentity`, `providerLifecycle`, and Book `marketIdentity`, `availability`, `levels[]` preserve totals family/type/group, `2H`, line `3.5`, selected outcome token, provider source, and bid ladder price/share identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | No frontend-only fixture is accepted by the proof; disposable provider rows are backend-shaped Polymarket/Gamma/CLOB data | Production replay on a real live Polymarket event remains future coverage. |
| Bid-side Sell limit order creation | Canonical order service backing `POST /api/orders` | POST | Canonical API key/idempotency flow in production; EO-A uses the route-backed service entry to avoid local trading-beta env flags | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side=SELL`, `type=LIMIT`, bid-row `price`, `size`, `contractSide=YES`, and `selection` born from Book provider depth, including `limitPrice`, `limitSide=bid`, and `limitShares` | Order response echoes `order.side=SELL` and `order.selection` with selected totals/provider/bid identity intact | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`; sell leg also uses existing share collateral/position state | None. Limit fields are sanitized into existing request JSON. | First-class immutable order/fill/trade/position selection columns remain future hardening. |
| Bid-side Sell portfolio/history lifecycle | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` | GET / GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection`, `positions[].selection`, `canceledOrders[].selection`, and `recentTrades[].selection` preserve totals market/outcome/type/group/line/period/side/contract side/provider ids/tokens plus `limitPrice`, `limitSide=bid`, and `limitShares`; open/canceled/recent activity preserve `side=SELL` | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Position`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` with the guarded request snapshot bridge | None in backend proof. Mobile fixtures are not used for EO-A identity. | Same-market/outcome multi-selection history still depends on the latest matching request snapshot until durable trade/position snapshots are approved. |

Cycle EO-A implementation notes:

- The proof starts from both route origins required by mobile, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book`, then uses the Book route bid level as the staged limit source.
- Focused route tests assert `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` preserve bid-side Sell totals snapshots with provider token identity.
- `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` remains optional/unconfigured and non-blocking; the proven path uses Polymarket-first quote and CLOB depth rows.

## Cycle EN Integrated - Route-Backed Provider-Depth Limit Lifecycle

Cycle EN integrated pairs backend/provider route proof with visible Android proof:

- Backend proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EN-A-route-limit-lifecycle/proof.json`.
- Integrated Android proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EN-integrated-route-limit-lifecycle/cycle-EN-B-visible-route-limit-lifecycle-proof.json`.

Backend/data dependency notes:

- Mobile consumes `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book`, `/api/markets/:marketId/quote`, and `/api/markets/:marketId/chart` from backend `http://127.0.0.1:3002` in server market-data mode.
- The integrated Android proof uses mock trading mode for submit/cancel, but the selected market/depth identity is route-backed from provider-depth rows and not arbitrary local UI-only data.
- Backend EN-A separately proves the selected provider-depth Book limit identity through the canonical order service contract, `/api/portfolio`, and `/api/portfolio/history` mapping.
- Production hardening still needs HTTP `POST /api/orders` route proof under the trading-beta environment, broader market-family/bid-side route-backed Android proof, and first-class immutable order/fill/trade/position selection snapshots.

## Cycle EN-A - Route-Backed Provider-Depth Limit Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-depth Book selection source | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | `markets[].selection`, `markets[].outcomes[]`, `markets[].orderbookDepth[]`, `markets[].orderbookIdentity`, `markets[].providerLifecycle`, and `markets[].providerOrderbookDepth` provide the selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, market group/type, line, period, side, provider source, external market/condition ids, token ids, and tapped Book ask/bid price/share level | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | No frontend-only fixture is accepted by the proof; disposable provider rows are backend-shaped Polymarket/Gamma/CLOB data | Production replay on a real live Polymarket event remains future coverage. |
| Book-staged limit order creation | Canonical order service backing `POST /api/orders` | POST | Canonical API key/idempotency flow in production; EN-A uses the route-backed service entry to avoid local trading-beta env flags | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, and `selection` born from live-detail provider depth, including `limitPrice`, `limitSide`, and `limitShares` | Order response echoes `order.selection` and `order.contractSide` with selected provider and limit identity intact | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. Limit fields are sanitized into existing request JSON. | First-class immutable order/fill/trade/position selection columns remain future hardening. |
| Route-backed limit portfolio/history lifecycle | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` | GET / GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection`, `positions[].selection`, `canceledOrders[].selection`, and `recentTrades[].selection` preserve selected market/outcome/type/group/line/period/side/contract side/provider ids/tokens plus `limitPrice`, `limitSide`, and `limitShares` | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Position`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` with the guarded request snapshot bridge | None in backend proof. Mobile fixtures are not used for EN-A identity. | Same-market/outcome multi-selection history still depends on the latest matching request snapshot until durable trade/position snapshots are approved. |

Cycle EN-A implementation notes:

- Proof script: `scripts/prove_mobile_en_a_route_limit_lifecycle.ts`.
- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EN-A-route-limit-lifecycle/proof.json`.
- The proof starts from `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` provider orderbook depth, selects an ask ladder level, and derives the order `selection` from that route payload before open/cancel/fill lifecycle assertions.
- Focused route tests now assert `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` preserve `limitPrice`, `limitSide`, and `limitShares` with provider token identity after current market metadata drift.
- `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` remains optional/unconfigured and non-blocking; the proven path uses existing Polymarket-first quote, CLOB depth, and CLOB chart rows.

## Cycle EM Integrated - Book-Staged Limit Lifecycle Proof Pairing

Cycle EM integrated pairs two evidence types:

- Service/backend contract proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EM-A-limit-lifecycle/proof.json`.
- Android-visible lifecycle proof: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EM-integrated-limit-lifecycle/cycle-EM-B-visible-limit-lifecycle-proof.json`.

Backend/data dependency notes:

- The selected staged limit fields use the existing `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, and `/api/portfolio/history` selection envelopes documented in Cycle EM-A.
- The integrated tablet proof was accepted as a fake-token visible lifecycle proof because it exercised the mobile state surfaces and was paired with EM-A's service proof. It did not prove a live route-backed provider-depth lifecycle from the tablet because backend health was unavailable in that launch context.
- No new schema migration or route shape was introduced in Lead integration.
- Remaining backend work is P1: route-backed provider-depth lifecycle execution through order/portfolio/history and durable first-class DB snapshots for same market/outcome multi-selection history.

## Cycle EM-A - Book-Staged Limit Lifecycle Service Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book-staged limit order creation | Mobile `submitTicketOrder()` -> `/api/orders` via `placeLimitOrder()` and canonical order normalization | POST | Server mode uses existing canonical API key/idempotency flow | `selection` now preserves `limitPrice`, `limitSide`, and `limitShares` with selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, family/line/period/side, display label, contract side, and provider identity | Immediate mobile order result keeps the staged Book limit fields in `result.selection`; backend `sanitizeTicketSelectionSnapshot()` keeps the same fields in `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody.selection` | Existing `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody` JSON snapshot; no schema migration | Mock order mode uses the same mobile `selectionForOrder()` path, so the service contract is identical for local ticket tests | Live Android route proof and immutable first-class order/trade selection columns remain future hardening. |
| Book-staged limit open orders and positions | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection.limitPrice`, `openOrders[].selection.limitSide`, `openOrders[].selection.limitShares`, and matching fields on `positions[].selection` survive mobile portfolio mapping | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` with existing request snapshot bridge for matching market/outcome | Mobile portfolio service tests use backend-shaped payloads, not UI-only fields | Filled positions still depend on the latest matching request snapshot or current market/outcome fallback; no immutable position snapshot column. |
| Book-staged limit activity/history | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `canceledOrders[].selection.*` and `recentTrades[].selection.*` carry `limitPrice`, `limitSide`, and `limitShares` into mobile activity rows | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mobile history mapper tests use backend-shaped canceled/recent trade payloads | Same-market/outcome multi-selection history remains limited by existing request JSON lookup until durable trade snapshots are added. |

Cycle EM-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EM-A-limit-lifecycle/proof.json`.
- Focused tests cover mobile order creation, mobile portfolio snapshot mapping, mobile history/activity mapping, and backend selection metadata sanitization/building for `selection.limitPrice`, `selection.limitSide`, and `selection.limitShares`.
- `sanitizeTicketSelectionSnapshot()` now preserves finite numeric `limitPrice`/`limitShares` and normalized `limitSide=bid|ask`, so Book-staged fields survive canonical request storage and later portfolio/history serialization through the existing selection snapshot JSON.
- No visible mobile UI, mobile smoke scripts, shared audit gate docs, Prisma schema, or migration files were changed.

## Cycle EL Integrated - Route-Backed Book/Ticket Limit Handoff

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Route-backed Book ladder to staged ticket | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET / GET | Public/mobile routes for live-detail and orderbook. Server order mode uses existing API key handling when a ticket is submitted. | Live-detail uses event slug. Book uses selected `marketId`, `maxLevels`, and mobile cache-buster `_ts`. Future order payloads preserve `selection.limitPrice`, `selection.limitSide`, and `selection.limitShares` from the tapped Book row. | Live-detail selected market/outcome identity, `orderbookIdentity`, provider lifecycle, chart status, and route-backed depth readiness. Book `levels[].side/price/shares/value`, `marketIdentity`, and availability. Mobile ticket consumes the selected `limitPrice/limitSide/limitShares` so price display and future order snapshots stay tied to the tapped ladder row. | Reads provider-backed `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`. Future order/portfolio/history flows use existing order selection snapshot fields. | The integrated proof uses the disposable EL-A provider event seeded through route/provider services, not arbitrary frontend-only data. No frontend fixture is accepted for the selected integrated pass. | Production proof still needs live real Polymarket mapped events and scheduled refresh breadth. A future backend/order cycle should assert `limitPrice/limitSide/limitShares` through server order creation, portfolio, and history. |

Cycle EL integrated implementation notes:

- Proof artifacts: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EL-integrated-live-depth/cycle-EL-A-provider-breadth.json` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EL-integrated-live-depth/cycle-EL-B-visible-live-depth-proof.json`.
- The Samsung tablet proof used backend event slug `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-bc35089a` against `http://127.0.0.1:3002`.
- The selected ask row staged Buy at `0.55` / 55c for 150 shares; the selected bid row staged Sell at `0.50` / 50c for 180 shares; both ticket price lines preserved the tapped Book level.

## Cycle EL-A - Provider Line-Family Breadth Route Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live-detail/provider-refresh line-family breadth | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` before and after `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | GET / POST / GET | Live-detail is public/mobile. Provider-refresh remains protected by internal/admin auth in production; the proof calls the shared route execution helper used by the protected POST. | Provider-refresh body uses `allowContractProofFallback=false`. | Refresh now returns `refresh.lineFamilyCoverage.source/generatedAt/compactMarketCount/familyCount/providerRefreshableFamilyCount/providerRefreshableMarketCount/readyProviderRefreshableMarketCount/hasProviderMappedBreadth/hasReadyProviderMappedBreadth/optionalLineProviderBlocking`, `families[]`, and per-market `markets[].selectorKey/marketFamily/period/line/providerRefreshable/status/ready/quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory`. Live-detail after refresh continues to expose each compact market's `providerLifecycle.quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory`, `orderbookIdentity`, `chartHistoryStatus`, and `orderbookDepthStatus`. | Creates disposable `Event`, `Market`, and `Outcome` rows. Refresh writes/reads `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` through the existing Polymarket Gamma/CLOB services. | Contract-proof fallback is disabled and asserted null. Provider fetches are deterministic Polymarket Gamma/CLOB-shaped responses scoped to disposable proof slugs/tokens. Missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` remains optional and non-blocking. | Production breadth still depends on live Polymarket mappings for actual World Cup events. Android-visible proof remains outside Agent A ownership. |
| Focused EL-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` | Local script calling route modules | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact records before unavailable compact markets, provider refresh completion, Gamma quote/CLOB depth/CLOB chart refresh counts for three mapped families, line-family coverage, cache invalidation for all family routes, after-refresh live-detail readiness, and optional/non-blocking line-provider state | Same backend provider tables as live-detail/provider-refresh; no schema migration | No frontend fallback. The proof uses route/service calls and fails unless moneyline, spread, and totals all become provider-ready without contract fallback. | Requires local database and dependency runtime. It is backend/provider route proof only. |

Cycle EL-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EL-A-provider-breadth/cycle-EL-A-provider-breadth.json`.
- `refresh.lineFamilyCoverage` is backend-owned route proof metadata; mobile can use it for diagnostics or readiness gating without deriving provider breadth from UI state.
- The proof shows three compact market families ready after refresh: moneyline, spread, and totals. Each preserves Polymarket quote, CLOB orderbook depth, CLOB chart history, selected market identity, selector key, line/period, and cache invalidation paths.
- No visible mobile UI, shared audit gate docs, Prisma schema, or migration files were changed.

## Cycle EK Integrated - Visible Provider Transition Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live-detail stale/refreshing/ready transition on tablet | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24`, and the provider-refresh route execution helper used by `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | GET / GET / local route helper | Live-detail and orderbook are public/mobile routes. Provider refresh remains internal/admin protected in production; the integrated proof calls the shared route execution body locally. | Live-detail uses event slug. Orderbook uses selected `marketId` and `maxLevels`. Refresh helper uses `allowContractProofFallback=false` for the existing disposable EK event. | `event.liveDataStatus.source/status/reason/lastUpdated`, `markets[].providerLifecycle.status/quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory`, `markets[].availability.status/source/reason`, selected `markets[].selection`, selected `markets[].orderbookIdentity`, Book `availability.status/source/reason`, Book `providerOrderbookDepth.status`, and ticket handoff fields from the selected market/line/outcome. | Reads live `Event`, provider-shaped `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`. The proof helper refreshes the existing disposable EK event with scoped Polymarket Gamma/CLOB-shaped provider stubs. | No frontend fallback is accepted for the selected transition. The tablet proof checks a stale/refresh-due state, runs refresh, then requires route-backed ready labels. Mobile orderbook requests add a timestamp query parameter so the tablet cannot reuse stale Book data. | Production scheduler execution and real provider-backed line-family breadth are still not complete. The helper proves the route path for one selected EK transition, not universal production refresh coverage. |
| EK integrated proof harness | `mobile/scripts/smoke-tablet.ps1 -EventDetailVisibleStatusTransition` plus `scripts/refresh_mobile_ek_provider_transition.ts` | Local harness | Local development device/database only | Device, backend URL, event slug, screenshot output, hierarchy output, and refresh summary path | JSON proof records before-refresh status, in-flight refresh UI, after-refresh live-detail status, Book/orderbook readiness, ticket settings handoff, route-backed labels, and provider refresh summary with `fallbackApplied=false` | Same provider snapshot tables as above; no schema migration | No arbitrary UI fixture is added. Existing deterministic provider responses are contract-shaped and only scoped to the proof refresh execution. | Fresh S23 Polymarket recapture and repeated production-family Android proof remain P1 follow-up work. |

Cycle EK integrated implementation notes:

- Proof artifacts: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EK-integrated-provider-transition/cycle-EK-B-visible-status-transition-proof.json` and `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EK-integrated-provider-transition/cycle-EK-B-visible-status-transition-refresh-route.json`.
- Live-detail now lets provider lifecycle downgrade a live event from ready to stale/unavailable when the provider route data is not ready, so the app no longer hides refresh debt behind stale top-level metadata.
- When provider lifecycle becomes ready after refresh, selected market availability and Book availability can be promoted from stale to route-backed ready only when provider quote/depth evidence is fresh.
- Mobile Book requests include a cache-buster query value to prevent stale device responses from masking the provider transition.

## Cycle EK-A - Provider Transition Route Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live-detail provider transition breadth | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` before and after `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | GET / POST / GET | Live-detail is public/mobile. Provider-refresh remains protected by internal/admin auth in production; the proof calls the route execution helper used by the protected POST. | Provider-refresh body uses `allowContractProofFallback=false`; no expire-first fallback is required. | Live-detail `markets[].providerLifecycle.status/ready/stale/refreshDue/unavailable/empty/notReady`, `markets[].providerLifecycle.quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory.source/status/reason/nextRefreshAt/lastFetchedAt`, `markets[].providerOrderbookDepth.status`, `markets[].chartHistoryStatus.status`, `markets[].selection`, and `markets[].orderbookIdentity`. Provider-refresh `providerLifecycle.refreshStarted/refreshStatus/refreshStartedAt/refreshCompletedAt/ready/fallbackApplied`, `refresh.provider`, `refresh.providerDepth`, `refresh.providerHistory`, `refresh.contractProofFallback`, `refresh.mappingReadiness`, and `cacheInvalidation.invalidated`. | Creates disposable `Event`, `Market`, and `Outcome` rows. Reads/writes `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` through the existing provider refresh services. | Contract-proof fallback is disabled and asserted null. Provider fetches are deterministic Polymarket Gamma/CLOB-shaped responses scoped to the disposable proof slugs/tokens; missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` stays optional/unconfigured. | Android-visible refresh/loading/ready pairing remains Agent B/Lead scope. Production line-family breadth still depends on real mapped Polymarket markets being available. |
| Focused EK-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_ek_a_provider_transition.ts` | Local script calling route modules | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact records ready Moneyline, selected stale/refresh-due Spread before refresh, provider-refresh completed lifecycle, selected Spread ready after refresh, unavailable Totals before/after, cache invalidation paths, no fallback, and selected identity preservation | Same existing backend provider tables as live-detail/provider-refresh; no schema migration | No frontend fallback. The proof fails if `mock-ready`, `fixture-ready`, `frontend-fixture`, `default-ready`, fallback depth, or first-row fallback markers appear. | Requires local database and dependency runtime. It is backend route proof only. |

Cycle EK-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EK-A-provider-transition/cycle-EK-A-provider-transition.json`.
- `executeMobileLiveProviderRefreshRoute()` is the shared route execution body used by protected `POST`; production auth behavior is unchanged.
- Selected transition identity is preserved by market id, selector key, family, period, line, and token ids across before live-detail, route refresh response, and after live-detail.
- Unavailable/not-ready Totals stays explicit and is not counted as ready evidence.

## Cycle EJ-A - Provider Status Breadth Route Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live-detail provider status breadth | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | `event.liveDataStatus`, top-level and `contract.providerLifecycle`, `contract.batchedProviderOrderbookDepthReadyCount/StaleCount/RefreshDueCount`, `contract.batchedChartHistoryReadyCount/StaleCount/RefreshDueCount`, compact `markets[].providerLifecycle.status/ready/stale/refreshDue/unavailable/empty/notReady`, `markets[].providerLifecycle.quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory.source/status/reason/nextRefreshAt/lastFetchedAt`, `markets[].providerOrderbookDepth.status`, `markets[].chartHistoryStatus.status`, `markets[].selection`, and `markets[].orderbookIdentity` | Reads compact live `Event`, provider-shaped `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows | None. The EJ-A proof fails if `mock-ready`, `fixture-ready`, `frontend-fixture`, or `default-ready` appears in the route payload. Missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` is non-blocking. | Android visible consumption and production mapped-market breadth remain Agent B/production coverage work. |
| Focused EJ-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_ej_a_provider_status_breadth.ts` | Local script calling the route module | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact records a ready moneyline, refresh-due quote plus stale depth/chart spread, unavailable/not-ready totals market, aggregate contract counts, Polymarket/CLOB sources, and no fixture/mock/default-ready markers | Creates one disposable live event with three compact markets and seeds only the backend provider snapshot tables needed for each state | No frontend fallback. The unavailable market intentionally has no provider snapshot rows and is not counted as ready evidence. | Requires local database and dependency runtime. It is backend route proof only. |

Cycle EJ-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EJ-A-provider-status-breadth.json`.
- The ready market proves `providerLifecycle.status=ready`, `orderbookDepthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, and `orderbookIdentity.ready=true`.
- The stale market proves `providerLifecycle.quote.status=refresh_due` while orderbook depth and chart history are `stale`.
- The unavailable market proves `providerLifecycle.status=unavailable`, `empty=true`, `notReady=true`, and route identity remains present without provider-ready labeling.

## Cycle EI-A - Route-Backed Provider Status Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tablet live-detail provider lifecycle/status rendering | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | `event.liveDataStatus.source/status/lastUpdated/reason`, top-level and `contract.providerLifecycle.status/source/reason/ready/stale/refreshDue/unavailable/empty/notReady/nextRefreshAt/lastFetchedAt`, selected `markets[].providerLifecycle.quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory.source/status/reason/nextRefreshAt/lastFetchedAt/ready/notReady`, `markets[].chartHistoryStatus.status/source/lastUpdated/nextRefreshAt`, `markets[].orderbookDepthSource/orderbookDepthStatus/providerOrderbookDepth.status`, and selected `markets[].selection` plus `markets[].orderbookIdentity` | Reads compact live `Event`, mapped `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | None. The EI-A route proof fails if `mock-ready`, `fixture-ready`, or `frontend-fixture` markers appear in the route payload. Missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` is non-blocking for this live-detail route proof. | Visible tablet rendering remains Agent B scope. Production line-family coverage still depends on mapped provider markets and scheduled refresh coverage. |
| Focused EI-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_ei_a_route_backed_status.ts` | Local script calling the route module | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact records liveDataStatus, chart status, orderbook/availability status, selected market identity, provider source/reason/freshness fields, aggregate lifecycle status, missing Optic Odds non-blocking state, and no fixture/mock-ready markers | Creates a disposable provider-backed event and seeds provider quote, provider orderbook depth, and chart snapshot rows consumed by the real live-detail route | No frontend fallback and no mobile smoke fixture. Disposable backend rows use the same snapshot tables as production refresh code. | Requires local database. It is backend proof only and does not replace Android/tablet UI proof. |

Cycle EI-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EI-integrated-route-backed-status/cycle-EI-A-route-backed-status.json` records the focused route proof for PM-GAP-084.
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EI-integrated-route-backed-status/cycle-EI-B-route-backed-status-proof.json` pairs the route proof with Samsung tablet UI proof for the same disposable event slug.
- The tablet proof consumes `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` through `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002`, requires `/api/health`, and preserves route-backed provider/source/status identity through live page, Book/orderbook, ticket handoff, and ticket settings.
- No backend route/service or schema source change was required after EH-A; EI integrated work changed proof seeding and mobile harness routing/expectations only.

## Cycle EH-A - Provider Status Surface Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Empty provider rows remain explicit as `status=unavailable`, `empty=true`, `notReady=true` | Real provider coverage for every production line-family compact market still depends on mapping and scheduled refresh coverage. |
| Provider refresh status transition | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` then `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | POST / GET | Provider refresh uses internal admin guard; live-detail is public/mobile | Optional `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | Refresh route `providerLifecycle.status`, `refreshStartedAt`, `refreshCompletedAt`, `refreshStarted`, `refreshing`, `refreshStatus`, `lastFetchedAt`, `fallbackApplied`, `fallbackReason`, and optional `lineProvider.status=unconfigured` when `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` is absent | Writes/reads `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`; refreshes Polymarket Gamma/CLOB for mapped markets | Contract-proof fallback remains opt-in and is labelled through `fallbackApplied/fallbackReason`; missing Optic Odds is optional/unconfigured, not blocking | Visible mobile rendering of the new status surface remains Agent B scope. |
| Focused EH-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_eh_a_provider_status_surface.ts` | Local script | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact with before stale/refresh-due market lifecycle, refresh-start/completion lifecycle, optional/unconfigured line-provider state, after ready market lifecycle, and unavailable control market lifecycle | Creates a disposable provider-backed event with one mapped market and one intentionally empty compact market; seeds provider quote/depth/chart rows for state transition | Deterministic CLOB-shaped proof fetches are explicit; quote fallback is marked when used | Requires local database. It is backend proof only and does not replace Android UI proof. |

Cycle EH-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EH-A-provider-status-surface.json` records the focused backend proof.
- PM-GAP-084 backend surface is closed for route shape: mobile can render ready, refresh-due, stale, refresh-started/completed, unavailable/empty, source, reason, next refresh, last fetch, fallback, and not-ready flags from backend responses.
- No mobile visible UI, mobile scripts, Prisma schema, or global audit docs were changed.

| Polymarket-first live-detail/provider refresh lifecycle | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` then `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | POST / GET | Provider refresh uses internal admin guard; live-detail is public/mobile | Optional `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | Refresh route now returns top-level `providerLifecycle.source/generatedAt/quote/orderbookDepth/chartHistory/ready/refreshDue/stale/nextRefreshAt`, plus `refresh.postRefreshDepth.lifecycle` and `refresh.postRefreshHistory.lifecycle`. Live-detail now exposes `markets[].chartHistoryStatus.stalenessSeconds/staleAfterSeconds/refreshTtlSeconds/nextRefreshAt/shouldRefresh/isStale` and contract `batchedChartHistoryReadyCount/StaleCount/RefreshDueCount/NextRefreshAt`. Book/live-detail depth continues to expose `providerOrderbookDepth.status/nextRefreshAt/shouldRefresh/isStale`. | Reads compact live `Event`, mapped `Market`, active `Outcome`; writes/reads `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`. | Production route uses Polymarket Gamma/CLOB by default. The EG-A proof uses deterministic CLOB-shaped depth/history responses only after Gamma quote refresh reports skipped, and labels that path with explicit `contractProofFallback`/fixture status. Missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` does not block the Polymarket path. | Production recurring refresh and full real-provider coverage for line-family markets remain outside this focused lifecycle proof. |
| EG-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_eg_a_provider_refresh_lifecycle.ts` | Local script | Local development database only | Optional `--output` / `--summaryPath` | JSON artifact with before stale live-detail contract, provider refresh lifecycle, CLOB depth/history refresh reports, skipped line-provider state, after ready live-detail contract, and assertions | Creates a disposable provider-backed event/market/outcome set, seeds stale quote/depth/chart rows, refreshes CLOB-shaped depth/history, and records the resulting route-shaped lifecycle state | Deterministic fixture is explicit: `providerSource=polymarket-first-with-deterministic-clob-fixture` and `fixtureStatus=explicit_contract_proof_fallback_for_gamma_quote_only` | Real Gamma quote success depends on live Polymarket slug availability for production-mapped events. |

Cycle EG-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EG-A-provider-refresh-lifecycle.json` proves stale -> ready for provider orderbook depth and chart history, with quote fallback explicitly reported and `lineProvider.status=skipped` not blocking the pass.
- The refresh path invalidates live-detail, event, chart, and orderbook route paths and now reports the lifecycle fields mobile needs to distinguish `ready`, `refresh_due`, `stale`, and `unavailable`.
- No mobile visible UI files were changed.

## Cycle EC-A - Provider Orderbook Identity Parity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live-detail compact market to Book identity carry-through | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` then `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public/mobile route then public visibility guard | Event slug; selected compact `marketId` for Book route | Live-detail compact `markets[].selection.selectorKey`, `markets[].orderbookIdentity.route/marketId/marketGroupId/selectorKey/marketFamily/period/line/outcomeIds/tokenIds/providerSource/providerStatus/depthSource/depthStatus/depthProviderStatus/depthProviderSources/refreshedAt/nextRefreshAt/shouldRefresh/isStale/ready/reason`, plus Book `marketIdentity.marketId/marketGroupId/selectorKey/marketFamily/period/line/outcomes[].id/outcomeId/tokenId`, `depthSource`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status/sources/latestFetchedAt/nextRefreshAt/isStale/shouldRefresh/reason`, and `levels[]`. | `Event`, `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`; local `Order` rows still take precedence in Book snapshot resolution | None in backend. The EC proof fails unless live-detail selects a provider-backed compact market and the corresponding Book route returns the same identity with ready provider depth | Real production line-family provider mappings/refresh coverage remain incomplete; EC documents the line gap when only match-winner is provider-backed. |
| Focused EC-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_ec_provider_orderbook_identity.ts` | Local script calling both routes | Local development/server only | Optional `--baseUrl`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | JSON artifact with live-detail selected compact identity, matching Book identity, provider depth summary, token equality, selector equality, and line-market gap note | Upserts a disposable World Cup-style event with match-winner and Totals markets, writes provider quote/depth rows for match winner, clears local open orders/provider rows for proof markets | None. Disposable provider rows use the same reference snapshot tables as production refresh code | Requires local database and a Next server running the current worktree code. |
| Focused route/service unit proof | `src/__tests__/mobile-live-event-detail.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/public.orderbook-book.no-leak.test.ts` | Jest | Local development only | Mocked service/route requests | Asserts live-detail `orderbookIdentity` and Book `marketIdentity.outcomes[].tokenId` align with compact selector identity while no private account/order fields leak | Prisma and orderbook snapshot service are mocked | None | Broader end-to-end visible mobile proof remains outside Agent A backend scope. |

Cycle EC-A implementation notes:

- `selection.selectorKey` is now compact and route-compatible: `marketGroupKey:period:line-or-default`. `marketId` remains explicit for uniqueness.
- Book `marketIdentity.outcomes[].tokenId` is a public provider contract id, not an auth token or credential. Sensitive owner/user/order fields remain excluded by no-leak tests.
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EC-A-provider-orderbook-identity.json` passed with `sameMarketId`, `sameSelectorKey`, `sameOutcomeIds`, `sameTokenIds`, provider source, ready depth status, and freshness assertions all true.

## Cycle EA-A - Live Detail Per-Market Chart Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live event page selected-market chart behavior | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | Top-level `event.chartHistory` remains primary-market scoped. Each compact `markets[]` row now includes `chartHistory[]` and `chartHistoryStatus.source/status/pointCount/outcomeCount/lastUpdated/stalenessSeconds/staleAfterSeconds/refreshTtlSeconds/nextRefreshAt/shouldRefresh/isStale/emptyState/range/ranges`. `contract` now includes `batchedChartHistorySource`, `batchedChartHistoryMarketCount`, `batchedChartHistoryPointCount`, `batchedChartHistoryReadyCount`, `batchedChartHistoryStaleCount`, `batchedChartHistoryRefreshDueCount`, `batchedChartHistoryNextRefreshAt`, `batchedChartHistoryRequestedMarketCount`, and `batchedChartHistoryRequestedMarketIds`. | Reads compact live `Event`, `Market`, active `Outcome`, provider quote/depth snapshots through existing Book snapshot service, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows for every compact market id. | None in backend. Markets with no history return `chartHistory=[]`, `chartHistoryStatus.status=unavailable`, and `emptyState=no-history`. | Real Polymarket/CLOB history ingestion for mapped Spread/Totals/Team Total line markets still depends on provider token mapping and refresh coverage. |
| Focused backend unit proof | `src/__tests__/mobile-live-event-detail.test.ts` | Jest service test | Local development only | Mocked event/market/snapshot inputs | Proves primary `event.chartHistory` remains separate from non-primary `market.chartHistory`, and proves selected line-market chart readiness can be audited by `marketId`. | No DB writes; orderbook snapshot service is mocked. | None | DB-backed route probe needs a seeded World Cup proof event in the active local database. |

Cycle EA-A implementation notes:

- The route now fetches chart snapshots for all `selectCompactLiveMarkets()` market ids with a bounded `compactMarketIds.length * 240` cap.
- Per-market chart status is backend-shaped and replaceable by real provider history: it carries source, status, point count, outcome count, last update, range, and empty state.
- This narrows the chart parity gap for line selector work because mobile no longer has to assume the primary market chart applies to the selected line market.

## Cycle DU-A - Provider Ready Line Orderbook Depth Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book ready provider line ladder | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public visibility guard; private markets still use existing access checks | Query params only: optional `outcomeId`, optional `maxLevels` capped at 200 | `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `availability.status=ready`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`, `providerOrderbookDepth.sources[]`, `marketIdentity.selectorKey`, `marketIdentity.marketFamily`, `marketIdentity.marketType`, `marketIdentity.marketGroupKey`, `marketIdentity.marketGroupId`, `marketIdentity.period`, `marketIdentity.line`, `marketIdentity.unit`, `marketIdentity.outcomes[].id`, `marketIdentity.outcomes[].side`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].value`, legacy `levels[].total`, `bids[]`, `asks[]` | `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`; local `Order` rows still have precedence if present | None in backend. The route reports `emptyState=no-depth` when neither local nor provider depth exists | Production-mapped World Cup line-family markets still need recurring provider refresh coverage outside disposable proof rows. |
| Focused DU-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_du_provider_line_orderbook_depth.ts` | Local script calling route | Local development/server only | Optional `--baseUrl`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | JSON artifact with route URL, compact first-half spread identity, provider depth source/status, selector key `spreads:first-half:1.5`, outcome ids, and side-labelled Price/Shares/Value rows | Upserts a disposable World Cup-style `Event`/`Market`/`Outcome` set, clears local open orders for that proof market, then writes provider depth rows | None. The proof fails if the route does not return provider-backed ready depth and line selector identity together | Requires an available local database and Next server for the HTTP route probe. |

Cycle DU-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DU-A-provider-line-orderbook-depth-proof.json` proves provider-backed ready ladder depth for a compact World Cup first-half spread market.
- The Book route now emits `levels[].value` as an additive alias for the existing notional `levels[].total`, making mobile XML/accessibility proof labels easier without breaking existing consumers.
- The DU-A artifact closes the backend half of PM-GAP-075 for provider-ready line identity: source/status, ready availability, selector key, family/type/group, period, line, outcome ids, level side, price, shares, and value are all route-backed in one response.
- Visible tablet proof still needs to consume this provider-backed route state in the same UI run before PM-GAP-075 can pass end to end.

## Cycle DT-A - Provider Ready Orderbook Depth Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book ready provider ladder | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public visibility guard; private markets still use existing access checks | Query params only: optional `outcomeId`, optional `maxLevels` capped at 200 | `marketIdentity`, `availability`, `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total`, `bids[]`, `asks[]` | `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`; local `Order` rows still have precedence if present | None in backend. The route reports `emptyState=no-depth` when neither local nor provider depth exists | Production World Cup compact markets still need mapped provider identity and recurring depth refresh coverage. |
| Focused DT proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_dt_ready_orderbook_depth.ts` | Local script calling route | Local development/server only | Optional `--baseUrl`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | JSON artifact with route URL, compact market identity, provider depth summary, and Price/Shares/Value row evidence | Upserts a disposable World Cup-style `Event`/`Market`/`Outcome` set and provider depth rows | None. The proof fails if the route does not return provider-backed ready depth | Requires an available local database and Next server for the HTTP route probe. |
| Focused route unit proof | `src/__tests__/public.orderbook-book.no-leak.test.ts` | Jest route test | Local development only | Mocked route request | Asserts provider-ready ladder shape, selector identity, numeric Price/Shares/Value rows, and no sensitive key leakage | Prisma and snapshot service are mocked | None | Broader live provider mappings remain outside this unit test. |

Cycle DT-A implementation notes:

- `marketIdentity` and provider depth are proven together so the Book UI can render a selected compact market without using fallback/unavailable depth.
- Earlier DT-A proof kept provider token IDs out of the Book identity. Cycle EC-A intentionally adds public provider `tokenId` to `marketIdentity.outcomes[]` for cross-route identity proof while credentials, owner IDs, user IDs, private order state, and condition IDs remain excluded.
- The route's depth precedence is unchanged: local orderbook, provider ladder snapshot, provider quote top-of-book estimate, then empty.

## Cycle DS-A - Orderbook Selector Identity Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book selector/depth identity | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book` | GET | Public visibility guard; private market access still uses existing user visibility checks | Query params: optional `outcomeId`, optional `maxLevels` capped at 200 | Existing `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `availability`, `emptyState`, `levels[]`, `bids[]`, `asks[]`, provider depth metadata; new `marketIdentity.selectorKey`, `marketFamily`, `marketType`, `marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupId`, `marketGroupTitle`, `displayOrder`, `period`, `line`, `unit`, `displayUnits`, `outcomes[]` | Reads `Market` plus active `Outcome`; reads local orderbook/provider snapshots through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | None. The route reports no-depth/availability truthfully and does not synthesize frontend-only family data | Broader production provider mappings for live line-family markets remain outside this route contract. |
| Focused backend proof | `src/__tests__/public.orderbook-book.no-leak.test.ts` | Jest unit route test | Local development only | Mocked route request for Moneyline, Spread, and Totals markets | Asserts selector-ready identity, public ladder units, active outcome list, and no sensitive key leakage | No DB writes; Prisma is mocked | None | Add integration proof against a seeded real event if Agent B needs an end-to-end sibling selector proof. |

Cycle DS-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-A-orderbook-selector-contract.json` records the focused backend proof.
- Cycle EC-A intentionally exposes public provider `tokenId` in `marketIdentity.outcomes[]` so live-detail and Book can prove the same outcome/token identity. Condition IDs, credentials, owner IDs, user IDs, and private order state remain excluded.
- This closes the backend-side compact market identity gap for Book selector/depth parity; mobile can switch/select line markets without inventing family, line, period, outcome, or display-unit labels.

## Cycle DS-B/Integrated - Visible Orderbook Selector And Ladder

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orderbook overlay selector/ladder | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book` plus existing event/live-detail data | GET | Public/mobile visibility guard | Optional selected market/outcome and max depth through existing mobile flow | `marketIdentity` when route-backed; existing `levels[]`, bid/ask prices, shares, value, `availability`, `emptyState`, source/status labels | `Market`, `Outcome`, local orderbook/provider snapshot rows | Existing contract-shaped fallback depth renders with explicit `Fallback depth` and unavailable labels when route-backed ready depth is absent | Need integrated provider-backed ready depth proof and selector carry-through for Moneyline -> Spread/Totals. |
| Tablet orderbook smoke proof | `mobile/scripts/smoke-tablet.ps1 -EventDetailOrderBook` | Local harness | Local device proof only | `-OutputDir`, `-HierarchyOutputDir`, `-Port` | Screenshots/XML for event detail, Book overlay, Book ticket, close state | No DB writes | Uses current mobile app state and backend availability | Add interaction steps for Yes/No tab switching, selector choice changes, and Decimalize/equivalent settings. |

Cycle DS-B/Integrated implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DS-integrated-orderbook-ui-proof.json` records the integrated partial proof.
- The Book overlay now depends on stable market/outcome identity and explicit depth status labels. It must not hide fallback/unavailable state as a ready provider-backed ladder.
- PM-GAP-075 remains open until selector changes, Yes/No tab switching, settings, and provider-backed ready depth are proven together.

## Cycle DR-A - Scheduled Provider Refresh Run Reporting

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduled provider refresh run report | `runScheduledMobileLiveProviderRefresh()` | Local scheduler service | Backend-only trusted caller | Optional `eventSlugs`, `maxEvents`, `refreshTtlSeconds`, `dryRun` | Backend operator/worker fields: `runId`, `startedAt`, `completedAt`, `durationMs`, `status`, `attemptedEventCount`, `successfulEventCount`, `failedEventCount`, `dryRunEventCount`, `refreshed[].status`, `refreshed[].error` | Reads `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, and `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`; scheduled execution writes provider quote/depth/history through existing refresh services | None. Scheduled execution keeps `allowContractProofFallback=false`; failed refresh attempts are reported, not filled with proof data | Durable run-history table, production retry/alert policy, and cron/queue registration remain future infrastructure work. |
| Scheduled provider refresh proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_scheduled_provider_refresh.ts` | Local script | Local development only | Optional `--eventSlug`, `--output`, `--staleSeconds` | JSON artifact with `expired`, `before`, `scheduler`, `after`, run-status assertions, and `pass` | Ages `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot.fetchedAt`, then refreshes through the scheduler service | None. The script fails if stale-to-ready or run reporting assertions do not pass | Keep the harness as backend evidence until deployed worker observability exists. |

Cycle DR-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DR-A-mobile-scheduled-provider-refresh-run-report.json` proves stale/refresh-due -> scheduler run report `status=completed` -> ready for `mobile-provider-refresh-proof-live`.
- The refreshed item reports `status=completed` with cache invalidation paths for live-detail, event, chart, and orderbook surfaces.
- The failure contract is unit-tested: provider refresh exceptions produce `status=completed_with_errors`, `failedEventCount=1`, and a sanitized per-event error while keeping contract-proof fallback disabled.

## Cycle DQ-A - Scheduled Provider Refresh Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduled provider refresh assessment | `runScheduledMobileLiveProviderRefresh()` | Local scheduler service | Backend-only trusted caller | Optional `eventSlugs`, `maxEvents`, `refreshTtlSeconds`, `dryRun` | `candidateCount`, `dueEventCount`, `candidates[].dueMarketIds`, missing/stale outcome counts, `nextAction` | Reads `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, and `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | None. The service only marks a market due when provider snapshots are missing or stale | Deploying this service behind a cron/queue worker remains future infrastructure work. |
| Scheduled provider refresh execution | `refreshMobileLiveProviderQuoteSnapshots()` via scheduler | Local scheduler service | Backend-only trusted caller | Due event slug; `allowContractProofFallback=false` | `provider.snapshotsUpdated`, `providerDepth.depthRowsUpdated`, `providerHistory.snapshotsCreated`, `lineProvider.status`, `postRefresh`, `postRefreshHistory` | Writes/reads `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` for mapped compact markets | Contract-proof fallback is disabled in the scheduled path | Production error taxonomy/retry policy is still light; line-provider enrichment can remain skipped without blocking Polymarket parity. |
| Mobile live-detail readiness after schedule | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public/mobile route | Event slug | `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotReadyCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotStaleCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotRefreshDueCount`, `batchedProviderOrderbookDepthReadyCount`, `chartHistorySource` | Reads compact live event, provider quote snapshots, depth snapshots, and chart history | None for the proof event; stale state is reported truthfully before refresh | Android smoke failed before provider assertions in this pass, so the route proof is the authoritative DQ-A evidence. |
| Scheduled refresh proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_scheduled_provider_refresh.ts` | Local script | Local development only | Optional `--eventSlug`, `--output`, `--staleSeconds` | JSON artifact with `expired`, `before`, `scheduler`, `after`, `assertions`, and `pass` | Ages `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot.fetchedAt`, then refreshes through the scheduler service | None. The script fails if stale-to-ready does not happen | Keep the harness as a backend proof until a deployed scheduler cadence exists. |

Cycle DQ-A implementation notes:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DQ-A-mobile-scheduled-provider-refresh.json` proves stale/refresh-due -> scheduler refresh -> ready for `mobile-provider-refresh-proof-live`.
- Missing `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` is not required for this Polymarket-first path. The proof event has no line-provider fixture, so `lineProvider.status=skipped` is expected while Gamma/CLOB quote, depth, and history refresh still pass.
- The scheduler returns cache invalidation paths for live-detail, event, chart, and orderbook consumers so mobile routes know which provider-backed surfaces changed.

## Cycle DF - Provider Mapping Operator UI

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operator readiness review | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | None | `compactMarketCount`, `providerRefreshableMarketCount`, `providerRefreshableOutcomeCount`, `totalOutcomeCount`, missing field counts, `markets[]`, `markets[].outcomes[]`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome` provider identity fields | None | Need real provider line-market slug source to reduce remaining missing mappings. |
| Operator dry-run review/apply | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `reviews[]`, `dryRun`, `confirmApply` generated from parsed operator input | `blocked`, `blockReason`, `preview.failedReviews[]`, `preview.attachReadyReviewCount`, `attach.validation`, `nextRequiredAction` | On confirmed all-pass apply, writes existing provider identity fields on `Market` and `Outcome` | None. UI dry-run and apply both use the protected route; failed reviews block in backend | Durable operator review audit log/table remains future work. |
| Operator input parser | `parseProviderSlugReviewInput()` | Local UI helper | Admin page only | JSON array/object or `marketId=slug1,slug2` lines | Normalized `{ marketId, slugs[] }[]` | None | None | No persistence of draft review input yet. |

Cycle DF implementation notes:

- The UI does not bypass the backend review gate. It only packages operator input for the protected `/provider-mapping` workflow.
- Confirmed apply is disabled until the operator checks `Confirm apply`.
- The UI is intentionally admin-only and separate from Holiwyn user mobile surfaces.

## Cycle DE - Bulk Review Apply Workflow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Review-first bulk provider mapping apply | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `reviews[]`, optional `dryRun`, optional `confirmApply` | `mode=bulk-manual-slug-review-apply`, `blocked`, `blockReason`, `preview.reviewCount`, `preview.attachReadyReviewCount`, `preview.failedReviews[]`, `attach`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome`; fetches exact Gamma `/markets?slug=...`; on confirmed all-pass apply writes `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, and `Outcome.referenceOutcomeLabel` | None. Failed review blocks all attach; no partial success is written | Need operator/admin UI to collect captured slugs and call this route. |
| Existing direct mapping apply | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | Existing `mappings[]`, `dryRun`, `confirmApply` | Existing validation and before/after readiness report | Same provider identity fields as above | None | Kept for lower-level tooling; operator flow should prefer `reviews[]` so relevance/family checks happen in the same apply cycle. |
| Bulk review/apply proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_bulk_review_apply_workflow.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | Proof artifact showing blocked mixed review, unchanged readiness, all-valid dry-run, confirmed apply, and after-apply readiness | Upserts local proof event/market/outcome rows shaped like compact live markets; applies real provider IDs only after all reviews pass | Uses real Polymarket slugs/tokens for match-winner mappings; guard totals market remains unmapped | Real line-market slugs are still needed before line markets can pass review/apply. |

Cycle DE implementation notes:

- `reviews[]` on `/provider-mapping` is the protected high-level apply path: review first, block on any failure, then dry-run or confirmed apply only when every review is attach-ready.
- The pass proof shows a bad totals review cannot be silently skipped while 3 match-winner markets are attached.
- The route returns `nextRequiredAction=fix_failed_slug_reviews_before_bulk_apply` for blocked review sets and `nextRequiredAction=run_provider_refresh_without_contract_fallback` after confirmed all-pass apply.

## Cycle DC - Bulk Manual Slug Review Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bulk exact provider slug review | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `reviews[]` where each review has `marketId` and `slugs[]` | `mode=bulk-manual-slug-preview`, `reviewCount`, `attachReadyReviewCount`, `candidateCount`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `mappings[]`, `results[].expectedProviderFamily`, `bestCandidate.attachReadiness.reasons`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome`; fetches exact Gamma `/markets?slug=...`; returned mappings can later be sent to `/provider-mapping` | None. The route is read-only and does not attach provider IDs | Need operator UI/admin flow to submit bulk reviews and then apply only all-approved mappings. |
| Bulk provider identity apply | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | Existing `mappings[]`, `dryRun`, `confirmApply` | Existing validation and before/after readiness report | Writes `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, and `Outcome.referenceOutcomeLabel` | None | Not changed this cycle; applying remains separate by design. |
| Bulk slug proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_bulk_slug_review.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | Proof artifact showing 3 attach-ready match-winner reviews and 1 rejected wrong-family totals review | Upserts local proof event/market/outcome rows shaped like compact live markets; does not apply returned mappings | Uses real Polymarket slugs/tokens for preview; no frontend-only mapping fixture | Real line-market slugs are still needed before line markets can pass bulk review. |

Cycle DC implementation notes:

- The bulk preview contract deliberately stops before attach.
- `nextRequiredAction=fix_failed_slug_reviews_before_bulk_apply` when any review fails, preventing partial silent completion.
- The proof shows wrong-family match-winner slugs cannot satisfy totals markets in bulk mode.

## Cycle DB - Provider Line Source Probe

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Line-market provider source probe | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_line_source_probe.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--output` | Exact event family summary, exact slug guess results, broad line-query ranked candidates, attach-ready counts, rejection reasons, `nextRequiredAction` | No DB writes. In-memory targets are shaped like compact `Market.marketType`, `Market.line`, `Market.period`, and active `Outcome` identity | None. The script does not attach provider identity or count local mock data as provider-backed | Need an actual provider source or operator-reviewed real exact slugs for line markets. |
| Exact provider event source | `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=...` | GET | Public provider endpoint | Query `slug=fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` | Provider event markets with `slug`, `question`, `id`, `conditionId`, `outcomes`, `clobTokenIds` | Would map into `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, and `Outcome.referenceTokenId` if a line family candidate existed | None. Current exact event exposes only match-winner candidates | Line-family markets are absent from the exact event payload for this checked event. |
| Exact line slug guesses | `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug=...` | GET | Public provider endpoint | 23 generated line slug guesses for spread, totals, team totals, first half, corners, and correct score | Exact market preview fields if a guessed slug exists | Same provider identity fields as above | None. Missing slugs return no candidates and are not treated as mappings | Need real slugs from reference app/operator review or another source; guessed patterns did not resolve. |
| Broad line search probe | `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?search=...` | GET | Public provider endpoint | Normalized line-market search queries per backend-shaped target | Ranked candidate `attachReadiness.reasons`, family, relevance report | None unless a candidate passes attach gates; none did | None. Broad candidates are rejected by family/relevance gates | Broad search still returns unrelated markets and is not a safe line mapping source. |

Cycle DB implementation notes:

- This cycle is read-only for provider mapping and DB state.
- The checked surfaces yielded 0 attach-ready line targets; this is documented as a source gap, not a feature-complete line-market claim.
- The existing match-winner provider mapping from Cycle DA remains healthy on Samsung tablet proof.

| Exact event plus manual slug fallback provider discovery | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | Query params: `providerSearchMode=sports-events`, optional `marketId`, optional `maxCandidatesPerMarket` | `providerEventSlugs`, `providerEventSlugSource`, `manualSlugFallbacks`, `manualSlugFallbackCandidateCount`, `providerCandidateFamilySummary`, `targets[].attachProposal`, `attachReadyCandidateCount` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome`; fetches Gamma `/events?slug=...` and exact Gamma `/markets?slug=...`; attach writes `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, and `Outcome.referenceTokenId` | None. Fallback slugs are exact provider slugs and still pass the same family, token, and relevance gates before attach | Need real provider source/slugs for line market families beyond match winner. |
| Provider discovery expansion proof | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_discovery_expansion.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | Proof artifact showing initial missing mapping, fallback slugs, 3 attach-ready candidates, attach result, no-fallback refresh, quote snapshots, and CLOB depth rows | Upserts local proof `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` rows shaped like provider-backed compact markets; uses existing attach and refresh services | No frontend-only fixture. Local proof rows are populated with real Polymarket identity and token IDs before refresh | Production importer should persist trusted provider event slugs and eventually include provider line-market slugs when available. |

Cycle DA implementation notes:

- The manual slug fallback is narrow and match-winner-only: `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03-col`, `-draw`, and `-gha`.
- The pass proof attached 3 real provider markets, refreshed 6 outcome quote snapshots, and wrote 246 provider CLOB depth rows without contract-proof fallback.
- Broad Gamma search remains unsafe for automatic line-market attach and is still blocked by the relevance/family gate.

## Cycle CZ - Line Slug Family Gate

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manual exact provider slug review for line markets | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `marketId`, `slugs[]` | `expectedProviderFamily`, `bestCandidate.attachReadiness.expectedFamily`, `candidateFamily`, `reasons[]`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `attachProposal` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome`; exact slug data comes from Gamma `/markets?slug=...` | None. Wrong-family exact slugs are rejected before attach; no local fixture counts as provider-backed | Need actual exact provider line slugs or another provider source for production line markets. |
| Line slug family gate proof | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_line_slug_family_gate.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--output` | Proof artifact showing accepted same-family total-goals candidate and rejected match-winner candidate for a totals target | In-memory market-shaped target only; does not write DB | No provider identity mutation | Replace synthetic candidate proof with real exact line slug preview when a provider line slug exists. |

Cycle CZ implementation notes:

- The route contract remains protected and read-only for previews.
- `provider_family_mismatch` is additive; relevance and token completeness remain required.
- Generic Over/Under line markets can pass only when the expected family matches and important match tokens overlap.

## Cycle CY - Provider Line Market Availability Diagnostic

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider market-family diagnostics | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | Existing discovery params; exact sports-event mode can derive event slug from `Event` data | `providerCandidateFamilySummary`, `providerEventSlugs`, `providerEventSlugSource`, `targets[].attachProposal` | Reads `Event`, compact `Market`, and active `Outcome`; exact provider candidates come from Gamma `/events?slug=...` | None. Missing line families are reported as zero counts; no local line fixture is treated as provider-backed | Need a real source for provider-owned line markets or reviewed exact provider line slugs. |
| Provider line availability proof | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_line_market_availability.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--output` | Exact event family summary, synthetic Holiwyn-shaped line target search results, attach-ready counts, insufficient-relevance counts, `nextRequiredAction` | Does not write DB. Uses provider candidates plus in-memory line target contracts shaped like `Market.marketType`, `line`, `period`, and `Outcome` identities | None. The script is read-only and must not attach or fabricate provider IDs | Production provider/import path still needs line-market provider identities for spreads, totals, team totals, halves, corners, and props. |

Cycle CY implementation notes:

- Exact event discovery for `fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` classified all 3 provider candidates as `match_winner`.
- Broad line searches returned noisy candidates, but the relevance gate kept attach-ready count at 0.
- This is a diagnostic contract improvement, not a claim that line-market provider parity is complete.

## Cycle CX - Provider Event Slug Hint Discovery

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider event slug hint discovery | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | Query params: optional `providerEventSlug(s)` override, `providerSearchMode`, `marketId`, `fetchProvider`, `maxCandidatesPerMarket` | `providerEventSlugs`, `providerEventSlugSource`, `targets[].attachProposal`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads `Event.externalSlug`, `Event.externalEventId`, `Event.source`, `Event.metadata`, compact `Market`, and active `Outcome`; does not write DB | None. Exact provider event hints only narrow provider search; candidates still must pass relevance and token completeness | Need provider event slug metadata on all imported World Cup fixtures; line markets still need provider slugs when available. |
| Event-derived provider attach proof | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_sports_event_discovery.ts` | Local script | Local development only | `--providerEventSlug`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` for setup; discovery call intentionally omits `providerEventSlugs` | Proof requires `providerEventSlugSource=event`, `providerEventSlugs[]`, 3 attach-ready markets, no-fallback refresh, and depth rows | Upserts a local proof `Event` with provider event metadata, compact `Market` rows, active `Outcome` rows; writes provider IDs through existing attach service | No frontend-only fixture. Local rows are provider-shaped and then populated with real Polymarket token IDs | Replace proof setup with production importer that persists exact provider event slugs for real World Cup fixtures. |

Cycle CX implementation notes:

- Request-provided provider event slugs still override event-derived hints for manual audit work.
- If an exact event hint is available, discovery uses `/events?slug=...` without broad tag discovery, so high-volume unrelated World Cup futures are not mixed into the focused live-match proof.
- The relevance gate from Cycle CV remains required before any attach proposal is considered ready.

## Cycle CV - Provider Candidate Relevance Gate

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider candidate discovery safety gate | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | Query params: `marketId`, `fetchProvider`, `maxCandidatesPerMarket` | `targets[].bestCandidate.attachReadiness.reasons`, `attachReadiness.relevance`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `providerErrorCount`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, and active `Outcome`; does not write DB | None. Real provider search is allowed, but unrelated candidates are reported as not attach-ready | Real matching World Cup soccer provider slugs/token IDs remain missing. |
| Manual slug preview safety gate | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `marketId`, `slugs[]` | Same candidate `attachReadiness` and `relevance` fields before any attach proposal can be used | Reads compact market/outcome identity only; attach still happens through `/provider-mapping` | No automatic attach. Even exact slugs must pass relevance and token completeness | Need reviewed exact soccer market slugs when provider search is noisy. |

Cycle CV implementation notes:

- A candidate can no longer be attach-ready only because it has `conditionId`, `externalMarketId`, `externalSlug`, and token IDs.
- The relevance report records `matchedImportantTokens`, `outcomeNameMatches`, required outcome matches, and score.
- The proof used real provider search and found 42 candidates, all rejected for relevance or outcome-shape mismatch.

## Cycle CU - Provider CLOB Depth Fetcher

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real provider CLOB refresh for compact live markets | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | Optional `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | `refresh.providerDepth.generatedAt`, `source=polymarket-clob`, `requestedMarketCount`, `refreshedCount`, `depthRowsUpdated`, `skippedCount`, `refreshed[]`, `skipped[]`; post-refresh live-detail/orderbook cache invalidation remains owned by the route | `Event`, provider-mapped compact `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | No frontend-only mock. The route fetches real provider CLOB data for mapped markets; disposable proof uses real provider identity on local proof rows | Real World Cup compact soccer markets still need provider mapping before this can cover production soccer events. |
| Selected Book after CLOB refresh | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `depthReason`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status`, `levelCount`, `snapshotCount`, `sources`, `bids[]`, `asks[]`, `levels[]` | Reads local `Order` rows first, then `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` rows written by the CLOB fetcher, then `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` top-quote fallback | No arbitrary local UI data. If CLOB rows are absent, the route truthfully falls back to provider quote top-of-book or empty state | Retention/cleanup of old provider depth snapshots remains open. |
| External provider order book dependency | `https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id=...` | GET | Public provider endpoint | Query string `token_id` from `Outcome.referenceTokenId` | Provider `bids[]` and `asks[]` price/size rows plus provider timestamp when present | Requires `Market.referenceSource=polymarket`, `Market.externalSlug`, and complete active outcome `referenceTokenId` values | Unit tests mock this provider endpoint; production refresh uses live fetch | Need production error taxonomy and retry policy beyond the current skipped/error report. |

Cycle CU implementation notes:

- The CLOB fetcher writes `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot.source=polymarket-clob`.
- Row freshness uses refresh time so route precedence is stable even when the provider book timestamp is older than the current process time; provider timestamp is still reported in refresh diagnostics.
- Cycle CU closes the real provider-owned depth fetcher gap for mapped markets, not the real World Cup provider-mapping gap.

## Cycle CT - Provider Orderbook Depth Snapshot Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider ladder-backed selected Book | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `depthReason`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status`, `levelCount`, `snapshotCount`, `sources`, `levels[]`, `bids[]`, `asks[]` | `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `Market`, `Outcome`, existing local `Order` rows, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` fallback | No frontend-only mock. Proof rows use the same `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` shape intended for future provider ingestion | Real provider CLOB fetcher is still missing. Real World Cup compact markets still need provider mapping. |
| Compact live-detail provider ladder summary | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `markets[].providerOrderbookDepth`, `markets[].orderbookDepthSource`, `contract.batchedProviderOrderbookDepthSource`, ready/stale/refresh-due counts | Same provider depth table plus compact selected `Market`/`Outcome` rows | No mobile local fixture. The adapter continues to consume backend route depth | The UI does not yet display a provider-specific ladder source label; it shows route depth. |

Cycle CT implementation notes:

- `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` stores durable provider ladder rows separately from local orders and top-quote snapshots.
- `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` source precedence is now local orders, provider ladder snapshots, provider quote top-of-book estimates, then empty.
- Local proof applied the Cycle CT SQL directly because the workstation database has migration-history drift.

## Cycle CS - Provider Quote Top-Of-Book Depth Bridge

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider quote top-of-book depth bridge | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `depthSource`, `depthReason`, `providerQuoteDepth.levelCount`, `providerQuoteDepth.sizeSource`, `providerQuoteDepth.isEstimatedSize`, `emptyState`, `levels[]`, `bids[]`, `asks[]`, `providerQuoteSnapshot.status` | Reads local open `Order` rows first; if no local ladder exists, reads `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot.bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `liquidityClob`, `liquidity`, `volume24hr`, and `volume` | No frontend-only mock. Provider top levels are generated only when provider snapshots expose prices plus liquidity/volume basis; otherwise the route keeps `emptyState=no-depth` | Full provider CLOB depth ladder is still missing. Cycle CS exposes truthful top-of-book provider quote depth only. |
| Server-hydrated EventDetail depth state | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `markets[].orderbookDepth[]`, `markets[].outcomes[].bestBidSize`, `bestAskSize`, selected event `orderbookDepthSource=orderbook-route`, `orderbookDepthStatus=ready`, `orderbookAvailability` | Same selected `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, and local `Order` rows | No mobile local fixture. Adapter preserves backend route depth when route returns it | Samsung tablet proof passed for the scoped provider quote bridge after reconnect. |

Cycle CS implementation notes:

- The provider quote depth bridge is intentionally labeled `provider-quote-snapshot`, not full provider orderbook depth.
- Size is estimated from provider liquidity fields and exposed through `providerQuoteDepth.isEstimatedSize=true`.
- Route proof and Samsung tablet proof passed for the scoped provider quote bridge.

## Cycle CR - Provider-Owned Refresh And Cache Invalidation

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real provider-owned compact live refresh | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | Optional `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | `refresh.provider.attempted`, `refresh.providerMappedMarketCount`, `refresh.provider.snapshotsUpdated`, `refresh.provider.refreshedCount`, `refresh.provider.skippedCount`, `refresh.contractProofFallback.applied`, `refresh.postRefresh.readyCount`, `refresh.postRefresh.staleCount`, `refresh.postRefresh.refreshDueCount`, `cacheInvalidation.invalidated`, `cacheInvalidation.errors` | Reads `Event`, compact `Market`, active `Outcome`; writes `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`; calls Polymarket Gamma using provider-owned `Market.externalSlug` / `externalMarketId` and `Outcome.referenceTokenId` identity | Explicit fallback remains opt-in. Cycle CR proof used `allowContractProofFallback=false`, so no local contract-proof fallback was applied | Real World Cup compact soccer event still lacks provider mappings for all compact markets; proof used a disposable mapped provider market. |
| Refreshed compact live-detail consumption | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotReadyCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotStaleCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotRefreshDueCount`, `markets[].providerQuoteSnapshot.status`, `shouldRefresh`, `refreshKey`, provider best bid/ask fields surfaced by mobile | Reads `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, and local order/depth data where available | No frontend-only mock. Missing rows report unavailable/stale instead of fake readiness | Provider-owned quote snapshots do not currently create local orderbook depth ladders. |
| Selected orderbook after provider refresh | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=2` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `providerQuoteSnapshot.status`, `shouldRefresh`, `refreshKey`, `snapshotCount`, `bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `levels[]`, `emptyState` | Reads selected `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, and open `Order` rows for local ladder depth | No fake depth is created; Cycle CR tablet proof shows provider best bid/ask with no local depth | Need a future provider/orderbook bridge if product requires provider-owned depth ladders, not only top quote snapshots. |
| Disposable provider proof setup | `scripts/prepare_mobile_provider_refresh_proof_event.ts` | Local script | Local development only | Optional `--providerSlug`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | Proof artifact with `eventSlug`, `providerSlug`, `eventId`, `marketId`, `conditionId`, `outcomeCount`, `snapshotCount`, `staleFetchedAt` | Upserts disposable `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, and stale `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows using real Gamma market identity | Fixture rows match the provider data contract and are intentionally disposable | Replace disposable proof setup with real World Cup provider import once soccer market provider slugs are confirmed. |

Cycle CR implementation notes:

- The provider refresh route now owns cache invalidation for the compact live-detail route, public event route, and affected orderbook routes through `next/cache` `revalidatePath`.
- The response is marked `no-store` so the refresh result itself is not cached.
- The proof route changed from stale/refresh-due to ready after real provider refresh, with `fallbackApplied=false`.

## Cycle CQ - Manual Provider Slug Preview Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manual compact-market provider slug preview | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `marketId`, `slugs[]` | `mode`, `marketId`, `requestedSlugs`, `providerError`, `candidateCount`, `bestCandidate`, `attachProposal`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`; provider preview uses Polymarket Gamma `/markets?slug=...`; does not write DB | None. The route returns explicit provider errors instead of fake candidates | Current proof environment still returns `fetch failed` for Gamma fetch, so real provider candidate preview remains open. |

Cycle CQ implementation notes:

- The route is protected because successful previews can expose provider market IDs, condition IDs, and token IDs.
- The route is read-only and prepares data for the existing provider identity attach endpoint.

## Cycle CP - Provider Candidate Discovery Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live provider candidate discovery | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | Query params: `marketId`, `fetchProvider`, `maxCandidatesPerMarket` | `result.targets[].queries`, `candidateCount`, `providerError`, `candidates[]`, `bestCandidate`, `attachProposal.mapping`, `attachReadyCandidateCount`, `nextRequiredAction` | Reads compact `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`; provider search uses Polymarket Gamma `/markets` and maps candidate fields to the existing attach contract shape | `fetchProvider=false` returns query contract only and does not call Gamma | In this run, provider fetch returned `fetch failed` for all 14 compact targets. Real provider identity import remains open. |

Cycle CP implementation notes:

- The route is protected because it can expose provider identity candidates and token IDs.
- The route never mutates `Market`, `Outcome`, or `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`; it only prepares reviewable candidate and attach-proposal data.

## Cycle CO - Provider Identity Attach Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live provider identity attach | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `dryRun`, `confirmApply`, `mappings[].marketId`, `referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `mappings[].outcomes[].outcomeId`, `referenceTokenId`, `referenceOutcomeLabel` | `result.validation.valid`, `errors[]`, `before.providerRefreshableMarketCount`, `after.providerRefreshableMarketCount`, `applied` | `Event`, compact `Market`, active `Outcome`; writes `Market.referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, `referenceOutcomeLabel` only when confirmed | Dry-run projection uses future-backend-shaped IDs and does not mutate local DB | Real provider candidate discovery/import for every compact World Cup live market remains missing. |

Cycle CO implementation notes:

- POST defaults to dry-run to prevent accidental fake provider mapping.
- A real write requires `dryRun=false` plus `confirmApply=true`, and each mapped compact market must include every active compact outcome.

## Cycle CN - Provider Mapping Readiness Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live provider mapping readiness | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | GET | Internal admin key or admin session | None | `readiness.compactMarketCount`, `providerRefreshableMarketCount`, `unsupportedSourceMarketCount`, `missingOutcomeTokenMarketCount`, `isProviderRefreshReady`, `nextRequiredAction`, `markets[].missingFields`, `markets[].outcomes[].missingFields` | `Event`, compact `Market`, active `Outcome`; required provider fields are `Market.referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, and `referenceOutcomeLabel` | None. The route is a readiness gate and must not fabricate provider identity. | Current local World Cup compact event has 14 compact markets but 0 provider-refreshable markets. |
| Compact live provider refresh blocked state | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | optional `allowContractProofFallback` | `refresh.mappingReadiness`, `providerMappedMarketCount`, `unsupportedMarketCount`, `provider.attempted`, `contractProofFallback` | Same compact `Market`/`Outcome` identities plus `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` when refresh can run | Fallback remains opt-in and was not used in the no-fallback proof | Real no-fallback refresh still requires imported Polymarket or production sports-provider market/outcome identities. |

Cycle CN implementation notes:

- The mapping readiness route is protected because it exposes provider identity and missing provider-token fields.
- This cycle is intentionally a structural gate. It prevents UI parity cycles from claiming provider readiness while compact live markets remain unmapped.

## Cycle CM - Provider Refresh Execution Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live provider refresh execution | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Internal admin key or admin session | `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | `expired.expiredSnapshotCount`, `refresh.provider.attempted`, `snapshotsUpdated`, `unsupportedMarketCount`, `contractProofFallback`, `postRefresh.snapshotCount` | `Event`, compact `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`; real refresh path uses Polymarket Gamma via `refreshPolymarketReferenceSnapshots()` | Explicit `allowContractProofFallback=true` can upsert future-backend-shaped rows only for local QA after the real provider mapping is reported unsupported | Current local World Cup compact event has `referenceSource=fifa_schedule`, so real Polymarket Gamma mapping is missing. |
| Live-detail stale-to-ready proof | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` and `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=2` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotReadyCount`, `StaleCount`, `RefreshDueCount`, selected `providerQuoteSnapshot.status`, `shouldRefresh`, `refreshKey` | Same `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows and selected `Order` depth rows | No frontend-only mock data; fallback writes the same provider snapshot table shape | Real provider refresh cannot complete until compact markets are imported/mapped from Polymarket or another sports odds provider. |

Cycle CM implementation notes:

- The route is protected because provider refresh mutates backend snapshot state.
- This cycle proves cache invalidation and refresh-state transitions, but it does not claim full real-provider parity for the local fixture event.

## Cycle CL - Provider Refresh Policy Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live-detail provider refresh policy | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotReadyCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotStaleCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotRefreshDueCount`, `batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotNextRefreshAt`, plus existing provider snapshot source/count | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows joined to compact `Market`/`Outcome` pairs | If snapshot rows are absent, counts remain zero and per-market snapshots report unavailable with `shouldRefresh=true` | Real provider-owned refresh execution, cache invalidation, and external error classification. |
| Selected orderbook provider refresh policy | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `providerQuoteSnapshot.refreshTtlSeconds`, `nextRefreshAt`, `shouldRefresh`, `refreshKey`, `status`, `stalenessSeconds`, `levels[]` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `Market`, `Outcome`, open `Order` rows | Deterministic local proof rows are future-backend-shaped and keyed by `marketId`/`outcomeId`/`source`; route stays truthful when rows are missing or stale | Real external provider ingestion should update rows continuously and own invalidation/update sequence. |
| Provider refresh policy proof | `mobile:live-provider-quote-snapshot-seed` plus direct route probe | Local script / GET routes | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Seed artifact plus route proof showing 14 ready markets, refresh TTL 60s, next-refresh timestamp, and selected second-half book policy | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | N/A | Replace deterministic proof rows with real provider feed once production ingestion is in scope. |

Cycle CL implementation notes:

- This cycle does not invent frontend-only refresh state; it exposes refresh policy from backend-shaped provider snapshot rows.
- It is still a partial PM-GAP-067 pass because the actual provider refresh worker/cache invalidator does not exist yet.

## Cycle CK - Live Provider Quote Snapshot Ready Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live-detail provider snapshot ready proof | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotSource`, `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotMarketCount`, `markets[].providerQuoteSnapshot.status`, `snapshotCount`, `acceptingOrders` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows seeded for compact `Market`/`Outcome` pairs | Deterministic local rows are future-backend-shaped and keyed by `marketId`, `outcomeId`, and `source` | Real external provider ingestion/refresh still missing. |
| Selected second-half orderbook provider snapshot ready proof | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=2` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `providerQuoteSnapshot.source`, `status`, `snapshotCount`, `latestFetchedAt`, `acceptingOrders`, `levels[]` | Same `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows plus open `Order` rows for depth | If snapshot rows are absent, route truthfully reports `unavailable`; Cycle CK proves the ready path | Provider cache invalidation/update sequence and provider-owned depth ladders remain missing. |
| Provider-shaped proof seed | `mobile:live-provider-quote-snapshot-seed` | Local script | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifact: compact market count, provider snapshot row count, upsert count, market preview | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, compact live `Market`, active `Outcome` | N/A | Replace deterministic proof rows with real provider refresh when external ingestion is in scope. |

Cycle CK implementation notes:

- This cycle proves the same contract added in Cycle CJ can move into a ready state for all 14 compact live markets.
- It does not mark backend provider parity complete because the rows are deterministic local proof data.

## Cycle CJ - Provider Quote Snapshot Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected orderbook provider snapshot status | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `providerQuoteSnapshot.source`, `status`, `snapshotCount`, `latestFetchedAt`, `latestUpdatedAt`, `stalenessSeconds`, `staleAfterSeconds`, `isStale`, `acceptingOrders`, `outcomeIds`, `sources`, `reason` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` joined by `marketId` and optional `outcomeId`; existing open `Order` rows for depth | If no provider rows exist, route returns `status: unavailable` rather than fake readiness | Provider ingestion must write current World Cup live quote snapshots. |
| Compact live-detail provider snapshot status | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `markets[].providerQuoteSnapshot`, `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotSource`, `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshotMarketCount` | Compact `Market` rows, active `Outcome` rows, open `Order` rows, optional `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows | Existing local/proof depth still renders; provider snapshot metadata can be unavailable | Provider-owned cache/invalidation and live liquidity remain missing. |

Cycle CJ implementation notes:

- This cycle uses the existing `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` schema instead of inventing frontend-only provider state.
- The public route intentionally excludes sensitive/provider-internal fields such as token IDs, external market IDs, condition IDs, credentials, owners, and users.

## Cycle CI - Depth Batching Policy Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live-detail depth policy metadata | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `contract.generatedAt`, `contract.maxMarkets`, `contract.marketCount`, `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthRequestedMarketCount`, `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthRequestedMarketIds`, `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthMaxLevels`, `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthCacheTtlSeconds`, plus existing `markets[].orderbookDepth[]` and outcome quote fields | Selected compact `Market` rows, active `Outcome` rows, open `Order` rows through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Local rows still render without provider depth; policy metadata stays present for route-backed compact responses | Real provider cache/invalidation layer, provider snapshot status per market depth response, and provider-owned liquidity ingestion remain missing. |
| Visible depth regression proof | Samsung tablet smoke against server-backed live detail | GET / device proof | Optional public viewing | None | `event-detail-market-depth-second-half-winner`, `market-depth-batched`, selected orderbook `orderbook-source-orderbook-route` | Same as above, with selected second-half market `ed121b08-88bd-4735-9793-64a0022e9696` | N/A | Need provider-scale batching/prefetch implementation behind the documented policy shape. |

Cycle CI implementation notes:

- This cycle reduces PM-GAP-067's repeated production batching/prefetch debt by defining and testing route-level limits, requested market IDs, max depth levels, generated time, and TTL.
- It does not mark backend parity complete because the route still uses current route-backed/local open orders rather than a provider cache with invalidation.

## Cycle CH - Batched Live Market Depth Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live market depth batching | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthSource`, `contract.batchedOrderbookDepthMarketCount`, `markets[].liquidity`, `markets[].orderbookDepth[]`, `markets[].outcomes[].bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `bestBidSize`, `bestAskSize` | Selected compact `Market` rows, active `Outcome` rows, open `Order` rows through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Local rows still render without `Route depth` when no server depth exists | Provider-owned liquidity ingestion and production-scale batching/prefetch policy remain missing. |
| Visible row batched-depth proof | Samsung tablet smoke against server-backed live detail | GET / device proof | Optional public viewing | None | `event-detail-market-depth-second-half-winner`, `market-depth-batched`, selected orderbook `orderbook-source-orderbook-route` | Same as above, with selected second-half market `ed121b08-88bd-4735-9793-64a0022e9696` | N/A | Need all visible provider markets to have live provider liquidity, not only seeded proof markets. |

Cycle CH implementation notes:

- This cycle closes a structural gap: compact live-detail no longer limits route-backed depth to the primary market.
- Direct route probe showed 14 compact markets and 6 markets with batched route-backed depth in local proof data.
- PM-GAP-067 remains open for real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats only if product keeps that tab, production batching/prefetch, and provider-wide liquidity for all line markets.

## Cycle CG - Second-Half Orderbook Depth Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected second-half orderbook proof | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for second-half winner market `ed121b08-88bd-4735-9793-64a0022e9696` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `marketId`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total`, `availability.status` | Open `Order` rows from deterministic depth seed, selected `Market(period=second-half)`, active `Outcome` rows | N/A | Provider-owned live liquidity remains required before backend parity can be marked complete. |
| Second-half seed/proof harness | `mobile:live-second-half-orderbook-depth-seed` and `smoke:tablet:server-live-second-half-order-book` | Local scripts / device proof | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--period=second-half`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifact records event, market id, market type, period, outcome ids, created order count, and depth preview | `Market`, `Outcome`, `User`, `Order` | N/A | Real provider market discovery/ingestion should own second-half pricing and market freshness. |

Cycle CG implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the repeated second-half separate depth proof debt left by Cycle CF.
- Halves orderbook parity is now proven for both first-half and second-half selected period markets.
- PM-GAP-067 remains open for real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats, production batching/prefetch, and provider-wide liquidity for all line markets.

## Cycle CF - Halves Orderbook Depth Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live first/second-half winner markets | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `markets[].id`, `marketType: match_winner_1x2`, `period: first-half/second-half`, `marketGroupKey: halves`, `availability`, `outcomes[]` | `Event`, `Market.period`, `Market.marketGroupKey`, `Outcome`, `Market.sourceUpdatedAt` | Local Halves rows remain fallback-only when server markets are unavailable | Real provider market discovery/ingestion should create/update half-period markets. |
| Selected first-half orderbook proof | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for first-half winner market `be4ab6f8-c054-4f6b-a6d9-7d857f7655ca` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `marketId`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total`, `availability.status` | Open `Order` rows from deterministic depth seed, selected `Market`, active `Outcome` rows | N/A | Provider-owned live liquidity remains required before backend parity can be marked complete. |
| Halves seed harness | `mobile:live-halves-markets-seed` and `mobile:live-first-half-orderbook-depth-seed` | Local scripts | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--period=first-half`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifacts record event, half markets, market ids, period, outcome ids, order depth preview | `Market`, `Outcome`, `User`, `Order` | N/A | Current database lacks a usable `Outcome(marketId, code)` conflict target, so the seed uses find-then-update. Production migration should confirm the intended constraint. |

Cycle CF implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the selected Halves proof item that was repeatedly deferred under PM-GAP-067.
- Halves are now backend-shaped and period-addressable instead of ad hoc local UI rows.
- PM-GAP-067 remains open for real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats, production batching/prefetch, and all-line provider liquidity. Second-half separate depth proof is closed in Cycle CG.

## Cycle CE - Compact Market Availability Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible live line-market availability | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `markets[].availability.source`, `status`, `marketStatus`, `lastUpdated`, `stalenessSeconds`, `staleAfterSeconds`, `isStale`, `isSuspended`, `isDelayed`, `reason`; existing market `id`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, outcomes | `Market.status`, `Market.sourceUpdatedAt`, `Market.updatedAt`, `Market`, `Outcome`; selected primary depth still uses open `Order` rows | Local fixtures may omit availability; server mode uses route-shaped `availability` when present | Real provider heartbeat/ingestion must update per-market timestamps/status before fresh provider parity can pass. |
| Team Totals pre-open availability proof | Samsung tablet smoke against server-backed live detail | GET / device proof | Optional public viewing | None | `event-detail-market-availability-team-total-goals`, `market-availability-stale`, `market-status-LIVE`, selected book `orderbook-availability-stale` | Same as above plus selected Team Totals orderbook rows | N/A | Provider-owned availability and all-line refresh remain missing. |

Cycle CE implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the repeated compact-route per-visible-market availability gap without inventing frontend-only state.
- The fixture/proof shape matches the intended backend contract, so future provider ingestion can replace the timestamp source without changing the mobile UI contract.
- PM-GAP-067 remains open for real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats, selected Halves proof, and provider-wide live liquidity.

## Cycle CD - Selected Orderbook Availability Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected market orderbook availability | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `availability.source`, `status`, `marketStatus`, `lastUpdated`, `stalenessSeconds`, `staleAfterSeconds`, `isStale`, `isSuspended`, `isDelayed`, `reason`; existing `levels[]` depth | `Market.status`, `Market.sourceUpdatedAt`, `Market.updatedAt`, open `Order` rows | Existing fallback orderbook data remains display-only when server mode is unavailable; server mode now exposes selected-market availability | External provider heartbeat/ingestion should own `sourceUpdatedAt` updates before production parity. |
| Selected Team Totals stale-state proof | `/api/orderbook/408ffb79-3492-4fd0-b31b-87a26f8b9dd5/book?maxLevels=2` and tablet smoke | GET / device proof | Optional public viewing | None | `availability.status: stale`, `marketStatus: LIVE`, route-backed bid/ask levels | Same as above | N/A | Need provider refresh path to turn stale live line books into ready/fresh state. |

Cycle CD implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the selected-market availability contract gap without pretending stale data is fresh.
- The proof shows a Polymarket-like distinction: the Team Totals market has depth but its source timestamp is stale.
- PM-GAP-067 remains open for real provider ingestion, per-line provider status sourced externally, provider-owned live stats, and broader liquidity.

## Cycle BC - Live Provider Freshness Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live event provider freshness | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `event.liveDataStatus.source`, `status`, `lastUpdated`, `stalenessSeconds`, `staleAfterSeconds`, `isStale`, `isSuspended`, `isDelayed`, `reason`; `contract.liveDataStatus` | `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows provide proof timestamps; `Event.metadata.mobileLiveDetail.liveDataStatus` can override provider state | If no timestamp or metadata exists, route returns `status: unavailable` instead of inventing fresh data | Real provider heartbeat/ingestion route and per-market/per-line availability fields remain missing. |
| Live game UI freshness proof | Server-backed mobile event detail | Client render | Optional viewing | None | Mobile `Event.liveDataStatus` displayed as `event-detail-live-data-inline live-data-status-* live-data-source-*` | Same route contract | Local event fixtures only omit this field; server mode displays it when present | Per-market status beside each adjustable line remains future work. |

Cycle BC implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the repeated unknown-contract part of provider freshness for live event detail.
- The contract is future-backend-shaped and uses stable fields that can be replaced by provider ingestion later.
- PM-GAP-067 remains in progress for real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats, per-line freshness, and all-line liquidity.

## Cycle BB - Selected Team Totals Ready Depth

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected Team Totals orderbook with ready depth | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for market `408ffb79-3492-4fd0-b31b-87a26f8b9dd5` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `marketId`, `emptyState: null`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total` | Open `Order` rows for selected `team_total_goals` market through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Local Team Total rows remain fallback only when server mode is unavailable | Real provider liquidity ingestion and freshness/stale/suspended metadata remain missing. |
| Team Totals market-type normalization | Compact live event markets from `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | backend `marketType: team_total_goals`, `line: 1.5`, outcome ids/sides/prices | `Market`, `Outcome` | Adapter aliases backend type to mobile `team-total` contract | Canonical market-type alias list should be documented before production ingestion. |
| Targeted Team Totals depth seed harness | `mobile:live-team-totals-orderbook-depth-seed` | Local script | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--marketType=team_total_goals`, `--line=1.5`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifact records event, market id/type/group/line, outcome ids, created order count, and preview rows | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | N/A | Provider-owned live liquidity remains required for production parity. |

Cycle BB implementation notes:

- This cycle closes selected Team Totals ready-depth proof after Cycle BA reserved Team Totals in the compact route.
- The proof uses stable backend market/outcome ids and public orderbook route fields, not frontend-only mock data.
- PM-GAP-067 remains in progress for provider ingestion, Halves selected depth, and freshness/stale/suspended states.

## Cycle BA - Compact Line Group Coverage And Totals Ready Depth

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live game line group coverage | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Optional for public viewing; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `markets[].id`, `marketType`, `marketGroupKey`, `line`, `period`, `outcomes[]`; route now reserves representative primary, Spread, Totals, and Team Total markets | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`; selected compact markets are still capped by mobile payload budget | Local line groups remain fallback only when server mode is unavailable | Provider/live availability states and broader market pagination remain missing. |
| Selected Totals line orderbook with ready depth | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for market `a552efe6-3147-4573-be95-8fe15c068c08` | GET | Optional public viewing | None | `marketId`, `emptyState: null`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total` | Open `Order` rows for the selected `total_goals` market through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Existing local Totals rows are only display fallback; server proof uses backend `total_goals` market identity | Real provider liquidity ingestion, market freshness, and selected Team Total/Halves depth proof remain missing. |
| Targeted Totals depth seed harness | `mobile:live-totals-orderbook-depth-seed` | Local script | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, `--marketType=total_goals`, `--line=2.5`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifact records event, market id/type/group/line, outcome ids, created order count, and preview rows | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | N/A | Provider-owned live liquidity remains required for production parity. |

Cycle BA implementation notes:

- This cycle fixes a backend/mobile contract mismatch: the server used `total_goals`, while the UI group is labeled Totals.
- The compact route now keeps representative rendered line groups instead of spending the whole cap on many Spread rows.
- PM-GAP-067 remains in progress because seeded Totals depth is proof data, not external provider liquidity.

## Cycle AZ - Selected Line Market Seeded Ready Depth

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected Spread line orderbook with ready depth | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for market `ac527022-07f3-4abb-90f0-b291466e8459` | GET | Optional for public viewing; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `marketId`, `generatedAt`, `emptyState: null`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total` | `Market`, `Outcome`, open `Order` rows created by the deterministic seed harness and read through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Existing local/embedded depth remains fallback only when server mode or route depth is unavailable | Real provider liquidity ingestion and freshness/stale/suspended metadata for all line markets remain missing. |
| Targeted line-depth seed harness | `mobile:live-spread-orderbook-depth-seed` running `scripts/seed_mobile_live_orderbook_depth.ts --marketType=spread --line=1.5` | Local script | Local development only | Optional `--eventSlug`, `--marketId`, `--marketType`, `--line`, `--summaryPath`, `--apply` | Summary artifact records event id/slug/title, selected market id/title/type/group/line, outcome ids, created/deleted order counts, and preview bid/ask rows | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | N/A | Provider-owned orderbook ingestion remains required before backend parity can be marked complete. |

Cycle AZ implementation notes:

- This cycle uses backend-shaped proof liquidity: every displayed bid/ask row maps to stable `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `price`, `shares`, and `total` fields from the public orderbook route.
- The tablet proof moves the selected Spread line market from `empty/no-depth` to `ready` route-backed depth while preserving selected market identity.
- PM-GAP-067 remains in progress because the real route/schema/provider pipeline still needs continuous live liquidity and availability state across all line-market groups.

## Cycle AY - Selected Line Market Depth Identity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected live line market order book | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` through `PolyApi.getOrderbook()` and `loadMarketDepthState(api, event, marketId)` | GET | Optional for public viewing; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `marketId`, `generatedAt`, `emptyState`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total` | `Market`, `Outcome`, open `Order` rows through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | UI keeps showing the selected market and truthful route empty state when no backend depth exists | Seeded/provider liquidity is still missing for most spread/totals/team-total line markets. |
| Live game order-book state identity | Client state plus orderbook route | Client state -> GET | Optional viewing | None | `orderbookDepthMarketId`, `orderbookDepthSource`, `orderbookDepthStatus`, `orderbookDepthEmptyState` | Same orderbook route plus selected mobile `Market.id` | Local fixtures remain fallback only when server mode is unavailable | Need on-demand depth hydration for every market group and a provider/source freshness model before production parity. |

Cycle AY implementation notes:

- This cycle closes a repeated structural ambiguity: the app can now prove which market id its order-book state belongs to.
- Empty depth is a valid backend state and is now visible for unseeded line markets instead of falsely reusing primary-market route depth.
- Backend parity is still incomplete until real or seeded liquidity exists for line markets beyond the primary winner market.

## Cycle AX - Compact Live Detail Route And Route-Backed Depth Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact live game detail | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` through `PolyApi.getEvent()` compact-first fallback | GET | Optional for public viewing; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `event.id`, `event.slug`, `event.title`, `event.status`, `event.startsAt`, `event.teams[]`, `event.liveStats`, `event.chartHistory[]`, `markets[]`, `marketGroupId`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `outcomes[]`, outcome `id`/`side`/`probability`/`bestBid`/`bestAsk`, primary-market `orderbookDepth[]`, and `contract` metadata | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, open `Order` rows through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` | Falls back to legacy `/api/events/:slug` if compact route fails; local fixtures remain last-resort app fallback | Real provider ingestion, provider-owned live stats, event-wide depth hydration, and richer suspended/stale states remain missing. |
| Live orderbook depth in game page | Embedded primary market `orderbookDepth[]` from the compact route | GET | Optional for viewing | None | `orderbookDepth[].outcomeId`, `side`, `price`, `shares`, `total`; EventDetail derives best bid/ask/spread and orderbook rows | `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Existing fixture depth uses the same outcome-addressable shape | Full per-market depth on every compact market is intentionally not embedded yet; dedicated book route remains available for deeper views. |
| Backend event launch proof | Expo deep link `forceBackendEventSlug=<slug>` then `PolyApi.getEvent(slug)` | Client launch -> GET | Optional viewing; server mode uses API base URL | None | Compact route result normalized into selected event/ticket state | Same as compact live detail route | If compact route fails, `PolyApi.getEvent()` falls back to legacy route | Production/native route restoration should be revisited when Holiwyn moves from Expo Go to dev build/APK. |

Cycle AX implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the repeated mobile payload/depth proof gap for PM-GAP-067: the tablet now proves route-backed live orderbook depth on the actual game page instead of only backend route tests.
- The compact route avoids heavy quote fan-out by hydrating depth for the selected primary market and capping the market list to a mobile-sized subset.
- Backend parity is still not complete until real live-football provider data populates live stats, chart history, and market availability states continuously.

## Cycle AU - Live Chart Route States

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live game chart lifecycle state | `/api/markets/:marketId/chart?range=<1D\|1W>` through `PolyApi.getMarketChart()` | GET | Optional for public markets; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `range`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `history[].outcomeId`, `history[].timestamp`, `history[].probability` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, market visibility guard | Embedded/local chart history remains visible, but route status is now explicit as `loading`, `empty`, or `error` | Real provider ingestion and a live server-hydrated device proof are still missing. |

Cycle AU implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the silent-fallback part of the chart route gap: empty/error/loading route states are now user-visible and XML-auditable.
- No new schema or route is required for the basic lifecycle contract because `/api/markets/:marketId/chart` already exposes `emptyState`, `range`, and `lastUpdated`.
- Server proof still needs the Cycle AT seed harness or real provider snapshots when backend services are available.

## Cycle AT - Live Chart Snapshot Seeding Harness

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server-hydrated live chart proof data | Seed script writes `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`; mobile reads via `/api/markets/:marketId/chart?range=1D` and `/api/events/:slug` | Script plus GET routes | Script uses local backend database access; GET routes remain public-visible guarded | Script args: optional `eventSlug`, `baseTime`, `summaryPath`, `--apply` | Route consumers use `history[].outcomeId`, `history[].timestamp`, `history[].probability`, and `emptyState` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Existing EventDetail fallback remains active when backend is unavailable or no snapshots exist | Real provider ingestion is still missing; Cycle AT only adds deterministic local/proof snapshot seeding. |

Cycle AT implementation notes:

- The seeding harness uses the same `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` table already consumed by event detail and chart routes.
- Fixture/dummy data is now future-backend-shaped because it is literally written as backend chart snapshot rows when the script can run.
- Backend/Docker was unavailable during proof, so the next active PM-GAP-067 cycle should run `npm run mobile:live-chart-snapshot-seed` and capture server-hydrated chart-source device XML once services are available.

## Cycle AS - Event Detail Chart Route Hydration

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible live event chart hydration | `/api/markets/:marketId/chart?range=<1D\|1W>` through `PolyApi.getMarketChart()` | GET | Optional for public markets; bearer token may be sent by runtime client | None | `history[].outcomeId`, `history[].timestamp`, `history[].probability`; mobile derives visible `event.chartHistory[]` and `chartHistorySource` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, market visibility guard | EventDetail keeps embedded `/api/events/:slug` chart history and local fixture chart arrays when the chart route is empty or unavailable | Real live-football snapshot ingestion, loading/error/empty UI states, and server-hydrated tablet proof remain missing. |

Cycle AS implementation notes:

- This cycle consumes the Cycle AR chart contract inside the game page instead of leaving it as an unused client method.
- The fixture fallback remains allowed because it already uses backend-shaped `outcomeId`/`timestamp`/`probability` points.
- Backend parity is still incomplete until real live provider snapshots are present and a device proof shows `chartHistorySource: "market-chart-route"` from the server.

## Cycle AR - Range-Aware Market Chart Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected market chart/history | `/api/markets/:marketId/chart?range=<1D\|1W\|1M\|MAX>` through `PolyApi.getMarketChart()` | GET | Optional for public markets; visibility guard still applies | None | `marketId`, `range`, `ranges[]`, `generatedAt`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `outcomes[]`, `history[].outcomeId`, `history[].timestamp`, `history[].price`, `history[].probability`, compatibility `series` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, market visibility/owner guard | Existing embedded `event.chartHistory` and local fixture arrays remain fallback until EventDetail consumes the route | Provider ingestion must write live snapshots; EventDetail still needs a UI integration cycle to replace local chart arrays with route data. |

Cycle AR implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the route/client-contract portion of the repeated chart-history gap.
- The endpoint remains public-safe and keeps the existing `series` field for web compatibility while adding mobile-ready `history[]`.
- Backend parity is still incomplete until real World Cup live market snapshots are ingested and device proof uses server-hydrated chart data.

## Cycle AQ - Live Chart History And Depth Identity Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live event chart history | `/api/events/:slug` | GET | Optional for viewing | None | `event.chartHistory[].outcomeId`, `timestamp`, `probability`; mobile filters by selected outcome id | `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `Event` | Event metadata `chartHistory` and local fixture chart arrays remain fallback when no snapshots exist | Real football provider ingestion and a range-aware dedicated history endpoint are still missing. |
| Live orderbook/depth identity | Embedded in `/api/events/:slug` market objects | GET | Optional for viewing | None | `orderbookDepth[].outcomeId`, `side`, `price`, `shares`, `total` plus outcome best bid/ask fields | Open `Order` rows through existing quote/orderbook aggregation; `Market`, `Outcome` | Fixture `orderbookDepth` uses the same outcome-addressable shape | Full depth ladder, timestamps, suspended/no-liquidity state, and per-market book range controls remain missing. |

Cycle AQ implementation notes:

- This cycle converts chart history from a metadata-only optional shape into a route-backed read model sourced from existing `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows.
- The route still falls back to metadata when snapshots are absent, which keeps fixture/server compatibility during provider rollout.
- Backend parity remains incomplete until live provider ingestion and dedicated/range-aware chart and depth routes exist.

## Cycle AP - Live Line Order Identity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live/line ticket submit | `/api/orders` through `PolyApi.placeLimitOrder()` | POST | Required in server mode; fake-token mock can run locally | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `contractSide`, `price`, `size`, `selection.marketId`, `selection.outcomeId`, `selection.marketGroupId`, `selection.marketType`, `selection.line`, `selection.period`, `selection.side`, `selection.displayLabel` | order id/status/size/remaining/fills and preserved request metadata | `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mock orders now also carry full `selection` identity | First-class `Order.selection`/`Trade.selection` columns do not exist yet; request-body reconstruction is the current bridge. |
| Portfolio open orders and positions | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Required for server portfolio; session fallback exists for web | `Authorization` bearer only | `positions[].selection` and `openOrders[].selection` with market/outcome/group/type/line/period/side/display label/contract side | `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `UserBalance` | Local Portfolio state uses the same `TicketSelection` shape | Filled position selection is inferred from market/outcome fields; exact submitted request metadata is only available for open orders. |
| Portfolio history/activity | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Required for server history; session fallback exists for web | `Authorization` bearer only | `canceledOrders[].selection`, `recentTrades[].selection` | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `LedgerEntry` | Local activity uses the same `TicketSelection` shape | Recent trades still infer selection from market/outcome schema because `Trade` has no direct order/request relation. |

Cycle AP implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the live line-order identity bridge for request, open order, canceled order, recent trade, position, and mobile Portfolio mapping.
- It intentionally avoids a schema migration by using existing `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody` and market/outcome line fields.
- A future backend cleanup can promote `selection` to first-class `Order`/`Trade` fields once the live market schema stabilizes.

## Cycle AO - Live Event Detail Backend Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live World Cup event detail | `/api/events/:slug` | GET | Optional for viewing; authenticated order routes later | None | `event.liveStats`, `event.chartHistory`, `market.id`, `marketGroupId`, `marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupTitle`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `liquidity`, `orderbookDepth[]`, `outcome.id`, `outcome.side`, `price`, `bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `bestBidSize`, `bestAskSize` | `Event.metadata` for optional provider-shaped `liveStats` and `chartHistory`; `Market.marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupTitle`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`; `Outcome.side`; `Order` depth through orderbook snapshot aggregation | Mobile local fixture remains fallback, but the mobile adapter now consumes the same route-shaped fields when server mode hydrates event detail | Real external live-football provider ingestion is still missing; event metadata must be populated before chart/live-stat panels show real values. |
| Live orderbook/depth | Embedded in `/api/events/:slug` market objects for top-level depth; existing dedicated book routes can still be used later for full depth | GET | Optional for viewing | None | `orderbookDepth[].outcomeId`, `side`, `price`, `shares`, `total`, plus outcome-level best bid/ask sizes | `Order` grouped open/partial orders through `buildPublicOrderbookSnapshot()` and `getOutcomeQuotes()` | Fixture `orderbookDepth` shape matches the embedded contract | Full depth by price ladder/range, depth timestamps, and no-liquidity/suspended states still need a dedicated route or richer embedded object. |
| Live ticket identity source | Event detail payload feeding existing ticket state | Client state, then existing order routes when submitting | Mock mode no auth; server submit requires API key | Future submit must preserve `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `marketGroupId`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `side`, amount, order side | selected event/market/outcome/line identity now survives backend route -> mobile adapter -> `EventDetail` model | Orders, positions, fills, open orders, activity/history | Existing fake-token ticket can open from backend-shaped live markets | Order submission/portfolio/history proof for live line markets is still PM-GAP-068 and not completed by this contract cycle. |

Cycle AO implementation notes:

- This cycle closes the repeated unknown-contract part of PM-GAP-067 for market groups, line identity, outcome side, top depth, and optional chart/live-stat payload shape.
- Backend parity is still not complete because real live-football provider ingestion, full chart history, and full depth routes are not implemented.
- The mobile adapter no longer drops backend market line identity, so future Samsung proof can test real route hydration instead of relying only on local fixture state.

## Cycle AN - Live Event Detail Structural Parity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live World Cup event detail | Intended `/api/events/:slug` live-detail payload or `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`; current cycle uses local fallback only | GET | Optional for viewing; authenticated order routes later | None | `event.id`, `title`, `status`, `startsAt`, `teams[]`, `markets[]`, `marketGroupId`, `marketId`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `probability`, `bestBid`, `bestAsk`, `liquidity`, `chartHistory`, `orderbookDepth`, `liveStats` | Events, teams, markets, market groups, line markets, outcomes, live score/state, quote snapshots, orderbook depth, market history, live stats | `worldCupEvents` live fixture now uses backend-shaped fields for Australia vs Egypt | Real backend route/schema does not yet provide grouped live game detail, live score, line markets, chart history, orderbook depth, or live stats. |
| Live ticket open | Client state from selected live market/outcome; existing order submit routes only after amount/order | Client state, then POST order when submitting | Mock mode no auth; server order mode requires API key | Future submit must include `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `marketGroupId`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `side`, amount, order side | selected event/market/outcome identity, live clock, quote/probability, line metadata | Orders, positions, fills, open orders, activity/history with live line identity | Tablet proof opens a live Australia ticket and preserves event/market/outcome in the ticket | Live order-to-portfolio/history identity is not yet re-proven with backend-shaped line fields. |
| Live chart/history | Intended `/api/markets/:marketId/history?range=live` or embedded event detail `chartHistory` | GET | Optional for viewing | None | timestamped `outcomeId`, probability/price points, range, lastUpdated | Market history, outcome price snapshots | Event `chartHistory` fixture feeds the chart series | No real chart-history route/schema currently backs mobile event detail. |
| Live orderbook/depth | Intended `/api/markets/:marketId/book` or embedded `orderbookDepth` | GET | Optional for viewing; authenticated for user-specific order actions | None | bid/ask levels with price, shares, total, spread, liquidity, lastUpdated | Order book, orders, liquidity/depth snapshots | Primary live market includes `orderbookDepth` fixture fields | Existing UI still partly uses local display rows; backend depth contract is not wired end to end. |
| Live stats | Intended `/api/events/:slug/live-stats` or embedded event detail `liveStats` | GET | Optional | None | stat id, label, home value, away value, timeline events, lastUpdated | Live match stats provider/cache | Event `liveStats` fixture feeds the Live stats panel | No real route/provider/schema for live football stats yet. |

Cycle AN implementation notes:

- This cycle intentionally does not mark backend parity complete.
- Frontend dummy data is now shaped like the intended backend contract, so future route integration can replace the fixture without changing the UI model.
- The next structural milestone should inspect Prisma/API support and implement or stub the real route/schema before more visual-only live-detail passes.

## Cycle T - Whole-App Navigation And Page Map

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home / World Cup discovery | `/api/events?category=sports&sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&search=World+Cup` | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | `events[]`, event id/slug/title/status/startsAt/markets/outcomes/volume/liquidity/traders | Events, markets, outcomes, sports/league taxonomy | `worldCupEvents` local mock data if server hydration is unavailable | Backend should eventually expose Polymarket-style sports/category rail metadata and page-map ordering. |
| Event detail entry from navigation | `/api/events/:slug` | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | event detail, markets, outcomes, line/selection metadata when available | Events, markets, outcomes, market groups, lines | Local event detail mock data from `worldCupEvents` | Full page-map route metadata is not provided by backend. |
| Live tab | Same event list route with local live filtering today | GET | Optional | None | event status and live clock-like fields when available | Events, market status, live state | Local filtering of mock events where `status === "live"` | Backend should provide a dedicated live sports feed or `status=live` filter. |
| Portfolio tab | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` when server mode is active | GET | Required for real user data; demo can run without auth in mock mode | None | wallet balance, positions, open orders, history/recent trades/canceled orders | Users, wallets, positions, orders, fills/trades, activities | Local fake 10000 USDT balance, local positions/open orders/activity | Auth/session model and production wallet are intentionally not complete. |
| Search tab | Same event list route with `search=<query>` | GET | Optional | None | filtered `events[]` | Events/search index, markets/outcomes | Local filtering over mock events/futures | Backend search ranking/categories are still thinner than Polymarket. |
| Account header entry | `/api/profile/preferences` when server mode and API key are available | GET/PUT | Required for server preferences; mock mode local only | PUT sends `ProfilePreferences` | language, ticket defaults, saved/profile preferences when supported | Users, profiles, preferences | Local AsyncStorage/preferences and mock signed-in state | Full auth, profile, KYC, wallet settings, notification settings are incomplete. |

Navigation-only implementation notes:

- This cycle does not add new backend calls.
- The main frontend state transition is `setMainTab()`.
- Account moved from bottom nav to header, but backend dependencies for account/profile remain unchanged.
- Polymarket reference shows Settings/profile outside the four bottom tabs, so future backend/profile work should treat account/settings as a top-level utility route rather than a primary market-browsing tab.

## Cycle U - Event Page Top Shell/Action Controls

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event detail top shell | `/api/events/:slug` through the existing event detail hydration path when server mode is active | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | event id/slug/title/status/startsAt, markets, outcomes, probabilities, prices, volume/liquidity/depth-like fields when present | Events, markets, outcomes | `worldCupEvents` local event detail data | Backend should expose enough metadata to identify primary market and top-shell context consistently. |
| Event Order Book overlay | No dedicated route in this cycle; derived from loaded market/outcome data | N/A | N/A | N/A | primary market title/outcomes, bestBid, bestAsk, bidSize/askSize or equivalent fallback values | Markets, outcomes, order book/depth snapshots, liquidity | Local deterministic depth rows from primary market outcomes | A dedicated live order-book/depth route is needed, for example `/api/markets/:id/book`, or included market depth snapshots in `/api/events/:slug`. |
| Event share sheet | No backend route | N/A | N/A | N/A | event title/slug and app-generated share copy/link | Events/shareable routes | Local share panel only | Production share links need canonical deep-link/web-link generation and localized copy. |

Cycle U implementation notes:

- This cycle does not create or modify backend routes.
- The top book action now maps to Order Book behavior, matching the Polymarket reference better than the previous watchlist notice.
- The future backend/schema milestone should treat order-book depth as a first-class data contract for mobile.

## Cycle V - Futures Market Rows

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Futures market rows | `/api/events?category=sports&sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup` when server discovery is active | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | future market id/title/type, outcome id/label/probability/color, volume/liquidity when available | Events, markets, outcomes, sports/league taxonomy | `worldCupFutures` local fallback data | Backend should expose complete futures outcome catalogs, outcome-level volume, and ordering. |
| Futures Buy Yes ticket | Existing ticket/order flow after local selection | Client state, then existing order routes when submitting | Auth required for server order submit; mock mode local | Ticket submit uses selected market/outcome/side/amount through existing order services | market id, outcome id, side, probability/price, liquidity/depth | Orders, positions, fills, wallets | Fake-token mock ticket and portfolio state | Route contracts need explicit binary YES/NO side semantics beyond generic buy/sell. |
| Futures Buy No button | No dedicated backend route in this cycle | N/A until submit | N/A | N/A | Uses selected outcome and `side: sell` approximation locally | Binary outcome order book, NO shares, order side model | Opens sell/no-side approximation | Backend/mobile contract needs true NO share or complementary-outcome order semantics. |

Cycle V implementation notes:

- This cycle does not create or modify backend routes.
- The mobile UI now expects outcome-level futures data that the backend should eventually own.

## Cycle AK - Futures Catalog Expansion

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collapsed World Cup Winner futures catalog | `/api/events?category=sports&sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup` when server discovery is active | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | future market id/title/type, ordered outcomes, probability/price, outcome display label, volume/liquidity when available | Events, markets, outcomes, sports/league taxonomy | `worldCupFutures` now provides 21 local World Cup Winner outcomes and collapses to the first three plus `18 more` | Backend should own full futures catalogs, ordering, and the collapsed row count. |
| Expanded futures catalog | Same discovery/detail payload when available | GET | Optional | None | all outcomes for a futures market, stable outcome ids, yes/no price, outcome volume, visual metadata | Futures markets, outcomes, quote snapshots, market stats | Expanded local fallback list renders all 21 outcomes | Backend should return full outcome catalogs and pagination/expansion hints for large markets. |
| Expanded-row ticket open | Existing ticket/order state after local selection | Client state; existing order routes when submitting | Auth required for server submit; fake-token mock can run without auth | Ticket submit uses selected market/outcome/side/amount through existing order services | market id, outcome id, contract side, probability/price | Orders, positions, fills, wallets | England expanded-row Buy Yes opens fake-token ticket locally | Backend order/quote routes should accept canonical outcome ids from expanded futures catalogs. |

Cycle AK implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- The mobile fallback catalog now mirrors the logged-in Polymarket collapse/expand structure, but backend discovery should eventually replace the static catalog and provide live ranking, prices, volume, and availability states.

## Cycle W - Futures Chart Range

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Futures chart/ranges | No dedicated route in this cycle; rendered from local future market/outcome data | N/A | N/A | N/A | outcome label, probability, color, market-level volume | Market history, outcome price history, time buckets | Local deterministic chart lines and local `selectedRange` state | Backend should expose market/outcome history series by range, for example `/api/markets/:id/history?range=1D`. |

Cycle W implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- The future API should return timestamped probability/price points per outcome, volume per range, and unavailable/empty states.

## Cycle X - Match Market Tabs And Cards

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event detail market tabs/cards | `/api/events/:slug` through the existing event detail hydration path when server mode is active | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | event id/slug/title/status/startsAt, market groups, outcomes, probabilities, prices, volume/liquidity when available | Events, markets, market groups, outcomes, line markets | Local `worldCupEvents` detail data and local tab/card renderers | Backend should expose explicit market tabs/groups such as Game Lines, Exact Score, Halves, and Player Props. |
| Team to Advance card | No dedicated route in this cycle; derived from loaded event/primary outcome data | N/A | N/A | N/A | outcome label/probability/color, card volume, depth-like rows | Markets, outcomes, order book/depth snapshots | Local card volume `$60.9K Vol.` and deterministic depth rows | Backend should identify card type, card volume, outcome prices, and market depth for `Team to Advance`. |
| Inline card graph | No dedicated route in this cycle | N/A | N/A | N/A | selected card/outcome identity and local graph state | Market history, outcome history | Local inline graph text/visual state | Backend should provide chart/history data for card-level market detail. |
| Exact Score tab | `/api/events/:slug` if server event detail eventually includes exact-score group | GET | Optional | None | exact score outcomes, prices/probabilities, volume/depth | Exact score markets, outcomes, order books | Local sample score rows | Backend should provide exact-score market groups and prices. |
| Halves tab | `/api/events/:slug` if server event detail includes halves groups | GET | Optional | None | first-half and second-half markets/outcomes | Half markets, outcomes, line groups | Existing local first-half/second-half groups | Backend should expose grouped first-half/second-half markets with ordering and prices. |

Cycle X implementation notes:

- This cycle does not create or modify backend routes.
- The mobile UI now expects event detail payloads to support explicit market tabs, card-level depth, card-level history, and grouped exact-score/halves markets.

## Cycle Y - Line Adjustment

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spread line selector | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional; bearer token sent if runtime API key exists | None | spread market group, line options, selected line, outcomes, prices/probabilities, period | Events, markets, line markets, outcomes, line quotes | Local line options and deterministic probability math | Backend should expose all spread lines by period with outcome ids, labels, prices, and market ids. |
| Totals line selector | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional | None | totals market group, line options, selected line, over/under outcomes, prices/probabilities, period | Events, markets, line markets, outcomes, line quotes | Local line options and deterministic probability math | Backend should expose all totals lines by period with stable market ids and prices. |
| Line ticket carry-through | Existing ticket/order flow after local selection | Client state, then existing order routes when submitting | Auth required for server order submit; mock mode local | Ticket submit uses selected market/outcome/side/amount plus line selection metadata | selected market type, line, period, display label, price/probability | Orders, positions, fills, wallets, line-market orders | Fake-token mock ticket and portfolio state | Backend order routes need explicit line market ids and line metadata to preserve identity in positions/history/open orders. |

Cycle Y implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Future backend work should treat line markets as first-class markets, not display-only modifiers.

## Cycle Z - Trade Ticket

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ticket open from event outcome | Loaded event data from `/api/events/:slug` when server mode is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event title, market id/title, outcome id/label/probability, selection metadata | Events, markets, outcomes | Local `worldCupEvents` fallback data | Backend should provide canonical market/outcome ids and line selection metadata for every ticket entry point. |
| Ticket amount and estimate | No dedicated route in this cycle; computed client-side | N/A | N/A | N/A | outcome probability, balance, side, amount | Quotes, order book, wallet balance | Local fake-token balance and deterministic estimates | Backend quote route should return live price, fees, estimated shares, payout/proceeds, and slippage impact. |
| Ticket submit readiness | Existing fake-token order path; server order routes when enabled | POST on existing order route when server mode submits | Required for real server order | market id, outcome id, side, amount, selection metadata | order id/status, filled shares, execution price, portfolio updates | Orders, fills, wallets, positions, open orders | Mock order state in fake-token mode | Server orders must preserve selected line/period/outcome and return enough data for portfolio/open-order/activity parity. |

Cycle Z implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Mobile now expects the same quick amount presets observed in Polymarket, but estimates still need backend quote support for production parity.

## Cycle AA - Portfolio

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fake-token Portfolio after mock order | Local mock state; `/api/portfolio` when server mode is active | GET in server mode | Required for server user data; not required for fake-token mock mode | None | balance, positions, open orders, recent activity, closed trades | Users, wallets, positions, orders, fills, activities | Local fake balance, local positions/activity after mock order | Server Portfolio must preserve selected line market ids and fill economics. |
| Open-order cancel | Local mock cancel path; `DELETE /api/orders/:id` in server mode | DELETE in server mode | Required for server cancel | order id | canceled order id/status, remaining/fill state, canceled activity metadata | Orders, order status, activity/history | Local open-order fixture and local canceled receipt | Server same-cycle Portfolio cancel proof should be rerun when backend parity is next prioritized. |
| Position re-trade/close entry points | Existing ticket open and close handlers | Client state; server order routes when submitting | Required for server trading | selected position, side, amount when ticket submits | position market/outcome/selection metadata | Positions, orders, fills | Local fake-token position actions | Backend should return canonical close/retrade quote and order status for each position. |

Cycle AA implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Portfolio docs now explicitly require server contracts to preserve selected line-market identity across positions, open orders, and activity.

## Cycle AB - Search/Explore

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search/Explore default list | `/api/events` through existing event hydration path when server mode is active | GET | Optional for public discovery | Query params currently handled by existing event list behavior | event id/title/status/tag/teams/markets/outcomes/probabilities | Events, markets, outcomes, market stats | Local `worldCupEvents` sorted by market/outcome depth | Backend should expose Search/Explore-ranked rows, not only raw event lists. |
| Typed World Cup query | `/api/events?search=<query>` when server mode is active | GET | Optional | Search query in URL params | matching events, teams, markets, outcomes | Event search index, team aliases, market text index | Client filters local events/teams/markets/outcomes | Backend should support ranked search across event, team, market, outcome, and localized names. |
| Search filter/sort | No dedicated route in this cycle; state is client-side over loaded events | N/A | N/A | status filter and sort mode | filtered/sorted rows | Search facets, status aggregates, market category counts | Local status filter and popular/live-first sort | Backend should provide category/facet counts, server-side rank, and cursor pagination. |
| Search result navigation | Existing event detail path after selecting an event | GET `/api/events/:slug` when server detail is active | Optional for viewing | event slug/id | full event detail markets and outcomes | Events, market groups, outcomes, order books | Local selected event opens detail | Backend route should preserve selected search result id/slug and hydrate detail consistently. |

Cycle AB implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Mobile now presents Search as an Explore-style page, so future backend work should treat Search as a ranked discovery endpoint with facets and row metrics.

## Cycle AC - Account/settings

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account/settings shell | `/api/profile/preferences` when profile sync is enabled | GET | Required when server profile sync is active | None | locale, saved event ids, ticket defaults, profile sync status | Users, profile preferences | Local AsyncStorage and app state | Backend should provide full account/settings menu state and auth/session state. |
| Mock login/logout | Local AsyncStorage only in this cycle | N/A | N/A | N/A | signed-in boolean | User session | Local mock session flag | Production auth route is intentionally deferred. |
| Fake-token balance safety | Portfolio/account state; `/api/portfolio` when server mode is active | GET | Required for server mode | None | wallet balance, open positions/orders, total exposure | Wallets, positions, orders | Local 10,000 USDT fake balance | Real deposit/withdraw/EBPay routes are intentionally not implemented. |

Cycle AC implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Account documentation now requires a future session/profile contract before production auth or real-money wallet actions.

## Cycle AD - Chart Behavior

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event detail chart display | `/api/events/:slug` through the existing event detail hydration path when server mode is active | GET | Optional for public viewing | None | event id/slug/title/status, primary market/outcome probability, selected outcome label, current event status | Events, markets, outcomes | Local `worldCupEvents` event detail data and deterministic chart point math | Event detail does not provide timestamped chart/history series, target/reference line metadata, or per-outcome historical probabilities. |
| Chart press/tooltip state | No dedicated route in this cycle; computed client-side from selected point | N/A | N/A | N/A | selected chart point label/value/time derived locally | Market history, outcome history, time buckets | Local `latest`/`mid`/`target` point states | Backend should expose nearest-point chart data so tooltip values reflect real historical ticks. |
| Chart filter state | No dedicated route in this cycle | N/A | N/A | N/A | local chart filter labels such as All/Game/Live | Market history ranges, period filters, live tick history | Local filter state and event status | Backend should support range/filter query params for market chart series. |

Cycle AD implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- A future route such as `/api/markets/:id/history?range=1D&outcomeId=<id>` or `/api/mobile/events/:slug/chart` should return timestamped probability/price points, selected outcome metadata, target/reference lines when applicable, loading/empty states, and range/filter support.

## Cycle AE - Market Page

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market/Live stats body switch | No dedicated route in this cycle; event context comes from `/api/events/:slug` when server mode is active | GET for event context | Optional for public viewing | None | event id/slug/title/status, teams, volume, current market probabilities | Events, teams, match state | Local `activeBodyTab` state | Backend should identify whether live stats are available and expose a stats route/state. |
| Live Stats panel | No backend route in this cycle | N/A | N/A | N/A | possession, shots, shots on target, corners, expected goals, match-flow events | Match stats, live feeds, timeline events | Local deterministic stats rows | Add route such as `/api/events/:slug/live-stats` with home/away stats, timestamps, availability, and empty/error states. |
| Grouped market tabs/cards | `/api/events/:slug` when server detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | market groups/tabs, outcomes, probabilities, line metadata | Events, markets, market groups, line markets | Existing local/fallback event groups | Backend still needs richer group metadata for exact Polymarket-style ordering and Player Props scoping. |

Cycle AE implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Mobile now expects a future live-stats data contract in addition to grouped market metadata, line-market identity, market depth, and chart history.

## Cycle AF - Reference Device Preflight Harness

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reference device preflight | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | None; this is an ADB/device harness. |

Cycle AF implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- The harness only inspects ADB device state and writes `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-current-polymarket-reference-device-preflight.json`.

## Cycle AG - Trade Ticket

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ticket open from event outcome | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event id/slug/title/status, market id/title/type, outcome id/label/probability/color, quote/depth fields when present | Events, markets, outcomes, order books | Local `worldCupEvents` event/outcome objects | Backend should provide ticket-ready market title, display period, selected outcome, opposite outcome, binary side semantics, and price/quote metadata. |
| Ticket amount and payout calculation | No dedicated route in this cycle; computed client-side from selected outcome probability | N/A | N/A | N/A | selected outcome probability, balance | Quotes, market depth, wallet balance | Local probability math and fake balance | Backend quote route should return executable price, payout, fees, min/max order size, and slippage bounds. |
| Advanced ticket details | Existing quote/orderbook fields when available through event/outcome hydration | GET for source event/quote context | Optional for viewing | None | best bid/ask, sizes, spread, trading mode | Order books, quote snapshots | Local fallback depth sizes and fake-token mode | Add a dedicated ticket quote/depth endpoint if event hydration is too coarse. |
| Submit fake-token order | Existing ticket order flow through `submitTicketOrder()`; server mode uses order API when enabled | POST in server mode | Required for server mode | market id, outcome id, side, amount, price/selection metadata | order id/status/fill/open-order/position metadata | Orders, fills, positions, activity | Mock order placement in fake-token mode | Binary NO/share side and production trading eligibility gates are not fully modeled. |

Cycle AG implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Mobile first-view ticket now expects market/outcome identity, quote/price, payout, and advanced depth/estimate data to be available in a ticket-ready shape.

## Cycle AH - Binary Side Ticket

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Futures Buy No ticket | Existing futures data from local/server event hydration | GET for market context | Optional for viewing | None | market id/title/type, outcome id/label/probability/color | Markets, outcomes, binary contracts | Local `worldCupFutures` rows | Backend should expose YES and NO contract ids/prices separately for each binary outcome. |
| Submit Buy No order | `/api/orders` through `PolyApi.placeLimitOrder()` in server mode | POST | Required in server mode | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, transaction `side`, `contractSide`, `price`, `size`, optional `selection`, `type`, `clientOrderId` | order id/status/size/remaining/fills | Fake-token mock order in local mode | Backend must accept and persist `contractSide` as separate from transaction side. |
| Portfolio display for No contracts | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/history` in server mode | GET | Required in server mode | None | positions/orders/history need selected outcome plus `contractSide` | Positions, orders, fills, activity/history | Local Portfolio state stores `contractSide` | Backend snapshot/history routes should return `contractSide` for positions, orders, canceled orders, and recent trades. |

Cycle AH implementation notes:

- Mobile now sends `contractSide: "YES" | "NO"` with server-mode order payloads.
- No backend route was changed in this cycle; this is a forward-compatible mobile contract update.

## Cycle AI - Trade Ticket Surface

| Tall ticket open from game outcome | `/api/events/:slug` when server detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event title/status, market title/type, outcome label/probability/color, selection metadata | Events, markets, outcomes | Local event/outcome data | Backend should return ticket-ready display metadata and eligibility state with event detail or a ticket quote route. |
| Swipe-ready amount state | No dedicated route in this cycle; calculated client-side | N/A | N/A | N/A | amount, selected side, selected contract side, probability | Quotes, wallet, eligibility | Local fake-token balance and probability math | A future ticket quote route should return executable price, payout/proceeds, fee, max/min, and whether swipe confirmation is allowed. |
| Production eligibility/location state | Not implemented in Holiwyn fake-token mode | N/A | Required for real-money mode later | N/A | eligibility status, block reason, support action, login/location state | Users, sessions, geo/eligibility checks | Fake-token mode always allows mock submit when amount is valid | Add server-authoritative `tradingEligibility` before real-money trading. |

Cycle AI implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- This cycle changes the mobile ticket surface only; server-mode order submission continues to use the existing order path.

## Cycle AJ - Game Page Compact Scrolled Header

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact scrolled match header | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event title/status/start time, teams, primary outcome probabilities/colors | Events, teams, markets, outcomes | Local event/team/outcome data | Backend should provide stable team codes, localized short names, and current probabilities for compact game headers. |
| Scrolled market rows proof | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | market groups, line values, periods, outcome probabilities | Market groups, line markets, outcomes | Local deterministic game-line groups and probabilities | Backend should provide Polymarket-style ordered market groups, line selectors, and per-period prices. |

Cycle AJ implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- This is a presentation-layer parity cycle; future backend work should make compact header and market rows server-authoritative.

## Cycle AL - Game Page Sticky Market Tabs

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sticky market tab rail | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event title/status/start time, teams, primary outcome probabilities, market tab/group availability | Events, teams, markets, market groups | Local event/team/outcome data and local tab list | Backend should expose ordered market tabs/groups and whether Player Props is available or empty for a given match. |
| Sticky Player Props switch | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | player props group rows, player names, stat type, prices, probabilities | Markets, player props, players, outcomes | Local Player Props rows | Backend should provide soccer player-prop availability and empty/loading states rather than relying on local fallback props. |

Cycle AL implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- This is a presentation-layer parity cycle; future backend work should return market-tab metadata and grouped rows in the same order the mobile page displays them.

## Cycle AM - Player Props Unavailable State

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Player Props unavailable state | `/api/events/:slug` when server event detail is active | GET | Optional for viewing | None | event id/slug/title and eventual Player Props availability flag | Events, markets, players, player props | Local unavailable state | Backend should eventually provide `playerPropsAvailability` and prop rows only when supported. |

Cycle AM implementation notes:

- No backend route was created or changed.
- Mobile intentionally avoids local fake player-prop rows until backend-supported Player Props data exists.

## Cycle AV - Live Orderbook Depth Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live event orderbook overlay | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?outcomeId=<optional>&maxLevels=<optional>` | GET | Public viewing | None | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `generatedAt`, `emptyState`, `levels[]`, legacy `bids[]`, legacy `asks[]` | Markets, outcomes, orders/orderbook snapshots | Embedded `market.orderbookDepth[]` remains visible and labeled as fallback when route data is unavailable | Real provider/orderbook ingestion, server-hydrated device proof, stale/delayed route states, and richer depth aggregation remain open. |
| Route-backed market depth hydration | `PolyApi.getOrderbook()` consuming `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book` | GET | Public viewing | None | `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total`, `emptyState`, `generatedAt` | Market/outcome identity, orderbook depth rows | `marketDepthService` only applies route-shaped data when the route returns levels; otherwise it preserves fallback rows and records `empty`/`error` state | Backend must guarantee that `marketId`/`outcomeId` match ticket/order/portfolio identity for selected line markets. |

Cycle AV implementation notes:

- The existing public orderbook route now returns a mobile-ready `levels[]` ladder while preserving legacy `bids[]` and `asks[]`.
- `maxLevels` is accepted and clamped server-side to avoid unbounded mobile responses.
- Mobile is wired to consume the route in server mode and exposes source/status labels so fallback proof cannot be confused with route-backed parity.
- Tablet proof was fallback-mode because backend health was unavailable; the backend route contract is covered by route/API tests.

## Cycle AW - Route-Backed Live Depth Seed Harness

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live event orderbook proof data | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` after `mobile:live-orderbook-depth-seed` | GET | Public viewing | None | `emptyState: null`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total` | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Existing fixture depth still drives tablet UI in mock mode | Mobile server-mode proof still needs an event/detail payload path that can hydrate the seeded market quickly and select the same market. |
| Live depth seeding harness | `mobile:live-orderbook-depth-seed` script | Local script | Local development only | Optional `--eventSlug`; default first live public World Cup orderbook event | Summary artifact with event id/slug/title, market id/title/type/group, proof users, deleted/created order counts, and preview rows | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | N/A | Real provider/liquidity ingestion remains missing; this is deterministic proof data only. |

Cycle AW implementation notes:

- The depth seed harness created 12 open proof orders for `world-cup-2026-curacao-vs-cote-divoire-2026-06-25` / `aca976d2-2bad-416c-b010-c874c0ee493f`.
- A direct orderbook route probe returned seeded `levels[]` with `emptyState: null`.
- `/api/events/:slug` returned a very large event-detail payload, while `/api/markets/:id/chart?range=1D` timed out during a 20-second probe. This promotes a mobile-optimized live detail/chart/depth payload to active structural work.

## Cycle CW - Provider Sports Event Discovery Expansion

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider candidate discovery by exact sports event | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-candidates?providerSearchMode=sports-events&providerEventSlug=fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` | GET | Internal admin guard | None | `targets[].bestCandidate`, `attachProposal.mapping`, candidate `slug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, outcome `tokenId`, relevance result | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`; provider identity fields on markets/outcomes | None for exact provider-event proof; broad tag discovery remains available when no exact event slug is supplied | More exact event/market slugs are needed for spreads, totals, team totals, halves, and props. |
| Provider identity attach for compact live markets | `attachMobileLiveProviderIdentities()` local/service path, same contract as protected provider-mapping route | Service/API contract | Internal admin guard when called through route | provider mappings with market id, external slug/id, condition id, outcome token ids | readiness moves to provider-refreshable compact markets | `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, `Outcome.referenceOutcomeLabel` | None for the proof event | UI/admin apply workflow should eventually review/apply mappings outside the proof harness. |
| Provider refresh and CLOB depth | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` equivalent service path | POST/service | Internal admin guard through route | `allowContractProofFallback=false` | refreshed count, snapshots updated, CLOB depth rows, post-refresh snapshot status | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | Contract fallback explicitly disabled | Broader provider ingestion scheduler remains needed. |
| Server-backed live detail proof | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | None | `event`, compact `markets[]`, `availability`, `providerQuoteSnapshot`, `providerOrderbookDepth`, `orderbookDepth`, contract readiness counts | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | Mobile fallback remains for non-server mode | First dev compile can be slow; production/dev-build route warmup should be included in harness setup. |

Cycle CW implementation notes:

- Exact provider event slug fallback prevents broad World Cup futures from being attached to the live match.
- The Samsung tablet proof uses `world-cup-2026-colombia-vs-ghana-2026-07-03` and confirms route-backed Book UI after provider refresh.

## Cycle DG - Provider Fixture Metadata Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider mapping readiness with fixture metadata | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | GET | Internal admin guard | None | Existing readiness fields plus `providerFixture.providerEventSlug`, `opticOddsFixtureId`, `opticOddsGameId`, `opticOddsNumericalId`, `sportradarGameId`, `teams[]`, `moneylineMarkets[]`, and `lineMarketSourceContract` | `Event.metadata.providerFixture`; existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` provider identity fields | None; proof extracts from real Gamma event metadata and stores the contract-shaped object on the local proof event | Real OpticOdds/API ingestion route for line-market families is still missing. |
| Provider fixture extraction proof | `scripts/prove_mobile_provider_fixture_metadata_contract.ts` against `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` | Local proof script | Local development only | Exact provider event slug | Extracted fixture IDs, provider team IDs, 3 moneyline markets, readiness compact-market counts, and future line-market source contract | `Event.metadata` stores the extracted provider fixture contract for later route use | None | Production importer should persist this metadata automatically for every trusted World Cup fixture. |

Cycle DG implementation notes:

- No public user route changed.
- The provider mapping readiness route now surfaces stored fixture metadata so future admin/operator and ingestion cycles can target the correct provider fixture instead of repeating broad Gamma line searches.
- The intended line-market source is recorded as `optic_odds`; this is a contract definition, not proof that line odds have been ingested.

## Cycle DH - OpticOdds Line Ingestion Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Line provider refresh report | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Internal admin guard | Existing body: optional `expireFirst`, `staleSeconds`, `allowContractProofFallback` | Existing refresh report plus `lineProvider.source`, `attempted`, `status`, `fixtureId`, `matchedMarketCount`, `snapshotRowsBuilt`, `snapshotsUpdated`, `skippedReason` | `Event.metadata.providerFixture`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | None. Missing credentials return `skippedReason=missing_optic_odds_api_key`. | Real OpticOdds credentials and reviewed per-line identity before applying live line rows. |
| OpticOdds fixture odds fetch | Official OpticOdds `https://api.opticodds.com/api/v3/fixtures/odds` | GET | `X-Api-Key: OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` | Query: repeated `sportsbook`, repeated `market`, `fixture_id`, `odds_format=PROBABILITY` | Fixture `id`, `game_id`, competitors, odds `id`, `sportsbook`, `market_id`, `selection`, `selection_line`, `team_id`, `price`, `points`, `is_main` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows with `source=optic_odds`; eventual first-class provider line mapping table if line identity review becomes durable | Contract proof uses official-response-shaped fixture data only; it does not write fake live rows | OpticOdds orderbook/depth support is not implemented; quote snapshots only. |

Cycle DH implementation notes:

- The endpoint contract follows the official OpticOdds docs for `/fixtures/odds`, including repeated sportsbook/market query params and API-key header auth.
- The current event diagnostic intentionally reports `readyForLiveProviderApply=false` until credentials and reviewed per-line provider market identity exist.
- This cycle moves the backend closer to real line ingestion without weakening the provider relevance gate.

## Cycle DI - Reviewed Line Provider Identity Gate

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewed line-provider identity readiness | Future protected provider-mapping/admin workflow using `reviewMobileLiveLineProviderIdentities()` | Future POST/service | Internal admin guard when routed | `reviews[]` containing `marketId`, `providerSource=optic_odds`, provider market id/name/type/period/points, and every local outcome mapped to a provider odd id | Readiness counts and validation failures for exact market/line/outcome identity | `Market.referenceMetadata.lineProviderIdentity`, `Outcome.referenceMetadata.lineProviderIdentity`; existing `Market`, `Outcome` | None. Dry-run projection is contract-shaped and does not mutate the database. | Protected route/UI for collecting confirmed line identity reviews and applying them with `confirmApply=true`. |
| OpticOdds row matching with reviewed identity | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` through existing refresh service once credentials and reviews exist | POST/service | Internal admin guard through route | Existing refresh request plus stored reviewed metadata | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows matched by provider market and provider odd ID when reviewed identity exists | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `Market.referenceMetadata`, `Outcome.referenceMetadata` | None. Missing reviews fall back to existing family/line/outcome matching for contract tests only. | Real `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY`, approved sportsbooks, and confirmed reviewed identities before live apply. |

Cycle DI implementation notes:

- No public user route changed.
- The service can apply reviewed line identity later, but the Cycle DI proof stayed dry-run to avoid writing unreviewed provider identity into the local database.
- The row builder now supports exact reviewed provider IDs, closing the ambiguity between same-family lines before the next live OpticOdds refresh attempt.

## Cycle DJ - Line Provider Refresh Execution

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewed line identity apply | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST | Internal admin guard | `lineIdentityReviews[]`, `dryRun`, `confirmApply`; each review includes local `marketId`, `providerSource=optic_odds`, provider fixture/market/line/period, and every outcome's provider odd id | Route returns review validation, before/after `lineProviderIdentityReadiness`, `applied`, `blocked`, and `nextRequiredAction` | `Market.referenceMetadata.lineProviderIdentity`, `Outcome.referenceMetadata.lineProviderIdentity` | None. Route defaults to dry-run and requires `confirmApply=true` for mutation. | Operator/admin UI fields for line identity capture can be added on top of the route. |
| Line-provider refresh execution | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` plus service `refreshMobileLiveProviderQuoteSnapshots()` | POST | Internal admin guard | Existing refresh body; production uses env `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY`/sportsbooks, proof injects official-shaped provider response | Mobile consumes refreshed `markets[].providerQuoteSnapshot` and `contract.batchedProviderQuoteSnapshot*` from `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows with `source=optic_odds`; reviewed market/outcome metadata | Contract fallback remains disabled in Cycle DJ proof. | Real API key/network proof, provider-owned ladder depth, and lifecycle ticket/order/portfolio/history proof. |

Cycle DJ implementation notes:

- `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` now exposes the reviewed line identity apply path instead of requiring direct script access.
- The proof harness shows target line markets moving from stale/refresh-due to ready in the same live-detail contract that the mobile page reads.
- Cache invalidation remains owned by `/provider-refresh` through `revalidatePath` for live-detail, event-detail, and affected orderbook paths.

## Cycle DK - Polymarket-First Provider Path

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Polymarket event discovery and mapping | Polymarket Gamma `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fifwc-col-gha-2026-07-03` through provider candidate services | GET/service | Public provider API; internal apply path remains guarded | Exact event slug plus generated manual slug fallbacks | Provider event title/slug, candidate market slug/question, external market id, condition id, outcome token ids, family/relevance fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`; provider identity fields on market/outcome records | None for the match-winner proof; irrelevant candidates are rejected instead of mocked | Exact line-family provider markets remain absent for this event through current Gamma discovery. |
| Provider identity attach | Existing provider mapping service path, same contract as `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-mapping` | POST/service | Internal admin guard when routed | 3 verified Polymarket match-winner mappings for Colombia, draw, and Ghana | Readiness changes to 3 provider-refreshable markets and 6 provider-refreshable outcomes | `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, `Outcome.referenceOutcomeLabel` | None | Operator UI can reuse this route for reviewed exact slugs. |
| Polymarket quote and CLOB depth refresh | Existing provider refresh service path, same contract as `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST/service | Internal admin guard when routed | `allowContractProofFallback=false`; `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` unset | `providerQuoteSnapshot.status=ready`, provider source, bid/ask/spread, `providerOrderbookDepth`, depth rows | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | Contract-proof fallback disabled | Scheduled/background refresh still needs production orchestration. |
| Server-backed live detail and orderbook proof | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`; `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug and selected market id | `liveDataStatus`, `liveDataSource`, compact markets, selected orderbook route source/status, levels, empty state | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | Expo/mobile fallback remains for offline mode, but Cycle DK tablet proof is server-backed | Chart history remains fallback until Polymarket-backed history is wired. |

Cycle DK implementation notes:

- Polymarket Gamma/CLOB is the default provider source for markets that exist on Polymarket.
- Missing OpticOdds credentials are optional/unconfigured and must not block this parity milestone.
- The relevance gate now blocks wrong-team binary winner attachment before provider identity is applied.

## Cycle DL - Polymarket CLOB Chart History

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider chart history ingestion | Polymarket CLOB `https://clob.polymarket.com/prices-history?market=:tokenId&interval=1d&fidelity=5` | GET/service | Public provider API | Token ID in `market` query param, interval, fidelity | Provider points `{ t, p }` converted to timestamp, price, probability | `Market`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | None in Cycle DL proof; empty history is recorded as skipped | First-class snapshot source column is still missing. |
| Mobile market chart route | `/api/markets/:id/chart?range=1D` | GET | Public viewing with existing market visibility guard | Market id and range | `source`, `history[]`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `range`, `series` | `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, `Market.referenceSource`, `Outcome` | If no rows exist, route returns `source=empty` and `emptyState=no-history` | Range downsampling/pagination can be added later if history grows. |
| Provider refresh orchestration | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` service path | POST/service | Internal admin guard through route | Existing refresh request | New `providerHistory` report with source, interval, fidelity, refreshed count, snapshots created, skipped rows | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Contract fallback still applies only to quote snapshots, not chart history | Background scheduler remains open. |
| Samsung tablet live-detail proof | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` plus `/api/markets/:id/chart` from the mobile app | GET | Public viewing | Event slug and selected primary market id | EventDetail XML marker `chart-source-polymarket-clob-prices-history chart-status-ready chart-range-1D` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | None for the chart marker in Cycle DL | Provider event is closed/resolved, so live-data status is stale by design. |

Cycle DL implementation notes:

- Official Polymarket docs name the CLOB price-history query parameter `market`, but it takes the outcome token ID.
- The current Colombia vs Ghana provider event is closed/resolved. Holiwyn keeps a live-detail proof page for parity work, while the provider freshness label remains stale.

## Cycle DM - Provider Token Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server-backed live event provider identity | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `markets[].referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `outcomes[].referenceTokenId`, `referenceOutcomeLabel` | `Market.referenceSource`, `Market.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.conditionId`, `Outcome.referenceTokenId`, `Outcome.referenceOutcomeLabel` | Mobile fallback events have null provider fields and are not marked provider-backed | None for Polymarket match-winner identity; line-family markets remain unavailable unless mapped. |
| Ticket order provider selection | `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical API key with `orders:write` and internal trading beta | Existing limit-order body plus `selection` provider fields | Order response id/status/size/remaining; request metadata later consumed by portfolio routes | `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody.selection`; existing `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mock orders preserve the same selection object locally | First-class `Order.selection` column is not present. |
| Portfolio provider identity echo | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `positions[].selection` and `openOrders[].selection` include market/outcome plus provider market/condition/token fields | `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Server-unavailable mobile fallback omits provider fields | No production migration yet for storing selection directly on positions/orders. |
| Portfolio history provider identity echo | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `canceledOrders[].selection`, `recentTrades[].selection` provider fields | `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None for Cycle DM proof | Recent trades without original request body rely on market/outcome provider fields. |

Cycle DM implementation notes:

- Provider lifecycle proof is Polymarket-first and does not depend on `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY`.
- Android proof uses accessibility markers only; provider IDs are not visible UI copy.
- `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1` now honors `-BackendBaseUrl` for server live-detail proof and asserts provider identity on the server-backed page and ticket.

## Super Round DN - Provider Chart Cache + Visible Orderbook

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider refresh cache lifecycle | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` | POST | Provider refresh admin/internal guard | Optional refresh execution options | `cacheInvalidation.chartPaths`, `cacheInvalidation.orderbookPaths`, `postRefreshHistory` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot`, orderbook depth rows | None | Scheduled/background refresh remains future work. |
| Visible orderbook ladder | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=...` through live-detail hydration | GET | Public viewing | Market id and max levels | `market.orderbookDepth[]`, `orderbookDepthStatus`, `orderbookDepthSource`, bid/ask price, shares, total | Orderbook depth snapshots keyed by market/outcome/side | Deterministic quote-shaped UI fallback when route levels are absent | Full provider-owned line-family depth remains unavailable unless Polymarket exposes matching line markets. |

Super Round DN implementation notes:

- Cache invalidation now includes `/api/markets/:marketId/chart` for every compact provider market, using the same market set as orderbook invalidation.
- Samsung tablet proof asserts `route-depth-ladder`, bid/ask level labels, provider source, provider market, provider condition, and provider token markers.

## Cycle DO - Provider Filled Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-backed filled order creation | `/api/orders` equivalent canonical service path in proof | POST | Canonical mobile API key with `orders:write` and internal trading beta | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, `selection` with provider fields | Filled order id/status, fills, position | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | Production route/device proof with a currently active real Polymarket market remains future work. |
| Portfolio provider position | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `positions[].selection.referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `referenceTokenId`, `referenceOutcomeLabel` | `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in proof | First-class immutable order/trade selection columns remain future hardening. |
| Recent provider trade activity | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `recentTrades[].selection` provider fields | `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in proof | Resolved-history settlement proof remains separate from filled-trade activity proof. |

Cycle DO implementation notes:

- `scripts/prove_mobile_filled_trade.ts` now creates provider-shaped market/outcome identity and submits the taker order through canonical order submission so the original ticket selection is preserved in `ApiOrderRequest`.
- Samsung tablet proof uses the existing Portfolio history smoke and asserts the provider-filled proof trade is visible.

## Super Round DT Integrated - Orderbook Interaction And Ready Depth

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book surface selected market/depth | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public viewing | Market id and max levels | `marketId`, `depthSource`, `availability.status`, `marketIdentity.selectorKey`, `marketIdentity.marketFamily`, `marketIdentity.marketType`, `marketIdentity.marketGroupKey`, `marketIdentity.period`, `marketIdentity.line`, `marketIdentity.outcomes[]`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].total`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, open `Order` rows when non-provider depth is used | DT-B tablet proof uses deterministic contract-shaped mobile fixtures for interaction proof when provider route data is not active in the Expo session | Same visible UI run still needs provider-backed ready depth; sibling selector route may be needed for all family/period/line choices. |
| Book tab/selector/ticket interaction | Mobile client state plus existing ticket/order services | Client state -> eventual order route | Fake-token trading only for this milestone | `TicketSelection` includes selected market, outcome, side, family, line, period, odds/probability when present | Existing order routes consume selected market/outcome IDs; portfolio/history later depend on the same identity | Fixture markets carry backend-shaped IDs, market type, line/period fields, and outcome IDs | Spread/period/line identity must be proven with a live backend-shaped route payload, not only fixture `line-none`/`period-none`. |

DT integrated implementation notes:

- Backend proof `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-integrated-ready-orderbook-depth-proof.json` shows `provider-orderbook-depth`, `availability.status=ready`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`, and 12 Price/Shares/Value rows.
- Tablet proof `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DT-B-orderbook-interactions/cycle-DT-B-holiwyn-orderbook-proof.json` shows Yes/No side switching, selector carry-through into ticket, and side-labelled bid/ask ladder markers.
- The backend contract is ahead of the visible UI proof. Do not mark PM-GAP-075 complete until the same tablet UI run consumes provider-backed ready depth and proves Spread/period/line carry-through.

## Cycle DV - Same-Market Provider-Ready Book UI

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider-backed live detail market hydration | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug `cycle-du-a-world-cup-provider-line-depth` launched through the mobile deep link | Event title, markets, market group/type, period, line, outcome ids/labels, provider source, external market id, condition id, outcome token id, orderbook route status/source | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | None in DV proof. The route uses the seeded provider-backed disposable event. | Broader sibling selector/options route is still useful for full Polymarket Book selector parity. |
| Provider-ready Book ladder | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public viewing | Market id `d08da13e-80b8-4452-9067-f91d08f6fba4` and max levels | `marketId`, `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth`, `availability.status=ready`, `marketIdentity.selectorKey=spreads:first-half:1.5`, `marketIdentity.marketType=spread`, `marketIdentity.period=first-half`, `marketIdentity.line=1.5`, `levels[].side`, `price`, `shares`, `value`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot` | None for DV route proof. | Current route is selected-market focused; full Polymarket selector sheet may need event/family sibling market data. |
| Ticket identity from provider-backed Book | Existing mobile ticket state and order service contract | Client state -> future `/api/orders` | Fake-token trading only for current milestone | `TicketSelection` built from selected provider-backed market/outcome | Event, market id, outcome id, side, market type, line, period, provider source, external market id, condition id, provider token marker | Existing mobile ticket/order service types and eventual `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody.selection` | None in DV proof. | Submit/order/portfolio/history lifecycle for this exact provider-ready Spread path remains future scope if required. |

Cycle DV implementation notes:

- The focused smoke command first runs the backend provider depth proof and then the Samsung tablet proof, so the app-visible markers are tied to the same seeded market id and selector key as the route JSON.
- The mobile UI now exposes `selected-selector-key-*` accessibility metadata for audit proof only; provider ids are not user-facing copy.
- DV closes the previous backend-only evidence gap for PM-GAP-075 without weakening the requirement that provider-backed ready depth must be Android-visible.

## Cycle DW-A - Provider Orderbook State Matrix

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider Book ready/non-ready state matrix | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` | GET | Public visibility guard; private markets still use existing access checks | Query params only: optional `outcomeId`, optional `maxLevels` capped at 200 | `depthSource`, `availability.status`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status`, `providerOrderbookDepth.reason`, `emptyState`, `marketIdentity.marketId`, `marketIdentity.selectorKey`, `marketIdentity.period`, `marketIdentity.line`, `marketIdentity.outcomes[].id`, `levels[].outcomeId`, `levels[].side`, `levels[].price`, `levels[].shares`, `levels[].value` | `Market`, active `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`; proof clears local `Order` rows and `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` rows for the disposable market | None. The unavailable state returns `depthSource=empty`, `providerOrderbookDepth.status=unavailable`, and `emptyState=no-depth`; it is not counted as ready route depth | Event-level sibling selector/options and production recurring provider refresh remain outside this focused backend state proof. |
| Focused DW-A proof harness | `scripts/prove_mobile_dw_provider_orderbook_state_matrix.ts` | Local script calling route | Local development/server only | Optional `--baseUrl`, `--eventSlug`, `--output` | Writes `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DW-A-provider-orderbook-state-matrix.json` with unavailable, stale, and ready route snapshots for one provider-shaped totals market | Upserts a disposable World Cup-style `Event`/`Market`/`Outcome` set, clears proof-market local and quote fallback inputs, then writes stale and fresh provider ladder rows | None. The proof fails if fresh ready state is not `provider-orderbook-depth` or if empty/unavailable is treated as ready evidence | Requires an available local database and Next server for the HTTP route probe. |

Cycle DW-A implementation notes:

- The DW-A matrix closes the DV harness gap by proving one provider-shaped selected market can report unavailable/empty, stale, and ready provider ladder states through the same Book route contract.
- Ready evidence is accepted only when `depthSource=provider-orderbook-depth` and `providerOrderbookDepth.status=ready`; the unavailable state clears quote snapshots so fallback quote rows cannot satisfy the ready assertion.
- The artifact records selector identity (`totals:regulation:2.5`), period, line, selected market id, and outcome ids in each matrix state.

## Cycle DX-A - Selected Line Order, Portfolio, And History Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected World Cup line order creation | Canonical order service backing `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical API key with `orders:write` | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, and `selection` containing `marketType`, `marketGroupId`, `line`, `period`, `side`, `displayLabel`, provider source/market/condition/token ids | Order response now echoes `order.contractSide` and `order.selection` | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | First-class immutable `Order.selection` column remains future hardening. |
| Selected line open order and position snapshot | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection`, `positions[].selection` with selected line and provider identity | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Mobile fallback fixtures are separate and not used in DX-A proof | Positions infer display label/contract side from market/outcome rows when original order request is not directly joined. |
| Selected line history activity | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `canceledOrders[].selection`, `recentTrades[].selection` with selected line and provider identity | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | Trade rows still rely on market/outcome metadata rather than an immutable trade selection snapshot. |

Cycle DX-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-DX-A-line-order-portfolio-history.json`.
- The proof creates a disposable World Cup Spread line market and verifies the same `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `marketType`, `marketGroupId`, `line`, `period`, `side`, `displayLabel`, `contractSide`, `referenceSource`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, and `referenceTokenId` through request, order response, portfolio open order, canceled activity, portfolio position, and recent trade activity.
- No visible UI, smoke script, Prisma schema, or central tracker edits were required.

## Cycle ED-A - Book Provider Identity Through Order, Portfolio, And History

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected provider-backed Book line order creation | `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book?maxLevels=24` for selected identity, then canonical order service backing `/api/orders` | GET, POST | Book route uses public visibility guard; order submit uses canonical API key with `orders:write` | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, and `selection` containing Book/provider identity: `marketType`, `marketGroupId`, `line`, `period`, `side`, `displayLabel`, `providerSource`/`referenceSource`, `externalSlug`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `tokenId`/`referenceTokenId` | Book `marketIdentity.outcomes[].tokenId`; order response `order.contractSide` and `order.selection` with both provider and reference source/token aliases | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order` | None in backend proof | First-class immutable `Order.selection` column remains future hardening. |
| Selected Book open order and position snapshot | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection` and `positions[].selection` preserve provider source, external market id, condition id, token id, line, period, side, and contract side | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | Positions still infer identity from current market/outcome rows when original request metadata is not joined. |
| Selected Book history activity | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `canceledOrders[].selection` and `recentTrades[].selection` preserve provider source, external market id, condition id, token id, line, period, side, and contract side | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | Trade rows still rely on market/outcome metadata rather than an immutable trade selection snapshot. |

Cycle ED-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-ED-A-book-order-portfolio-history.json`.
- The proof creates a disposable provider-backed Spread Book market, seeds provider ladder rows, reads `/api/orderbook/:marketId/book`, and verifies the selected outcome token survives through order request, order response, portfolio open order, canceled activity, portfolio position, and recent trade activity.
- `selection.providerSource`/`selection.tokenId` are now preserved alongside existing `selection.referenceSource`/`selection.referenceTokenId`, so Book-style and current mobile-style names can round-trip without a schema migration.
- No visible UI, smoke script, Prisma schema, or audit/tracker files were changed.

## Cycle EE-A - Book Lifecycle Selection Snapshots

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected Book order response/open order/cancel lifecycle | `/api/orders` backed by canonical order service, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST, GET | Canonical API key with `orders:write` for submit and `account:read` for portfolio reads | Order submit includes normalized `selection` from Book: `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `marketType`, `marketGroupId`, `line`, `period`, `side`, provider source/market/condition/token, and `contractSide` | `order.selection`, `openOrders[].selection`, `canceledOrders[].selection` are normalized by the shared ticket selection snapshot helper | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | First-class order selection columns remain future production hardening. |
| Selected Book filled position and recent trade snapshot | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `positions[].selection` and `recentTrades[].selection` prefer the latest matching same-user/same-market/same-outcome `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody.selection`, guarded by matching `marketId` and `outcomeId`, then fall back to current `Market`/`Outcome` metadata | `Position`, `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in backend proof | There is still no immutable `Trade`/`Position` selection snapshot column; same market/outcome multiple-selection history can only use the latest matching request snapshot until schema work is approved. |

Cycle EE-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EE-A-lifecycle-snapshots.json`.
- `sanitizeTicketSelectionSnapshot()` is now shared by canonical order submission and portfolio metadata serialization, so Book aliases (`providerSource`, `tokenId`) and reference aliases (`referenceSource`, `referenceTokenId`) normalize identically.
- Filled position and recent trade routes now avoid moneyline/default fallback for a selected Spread/line/period/provider token when a matching order request snapshot exists.
- No visible mobile UI, mobile scripts, Prisma schema, migrations, audit-gate docs, or Polymarket gate/index files were changed.

## Cycle EF-A - Snapshot Durability After Metadata Drift

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Historical Portfolio open/canceled/filled selection display after mutable metadata changes | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or canonical API key with `account:read` | None | `openOrders[].selection`, `positions[].selection`, `canceledOrders[].selection`, and `recentTrades[].selection` prefer the matching order-time/fill-time `ApiOrderRequest.requestBody.selection` for market/outcome/type/group/line/period/side/display label/source/market/condition/token fields | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Position`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Current `Market`/`Outcome` fields remain a guarded fallback only when no matching request snapshot exists | First-class immutable `Trade`/`Position` selection columns remain future production hardening for arbitrary remaps and same market/outcome multi-selection history. |

Cycle EF-A implementation notes:

- Proof artifact/status: `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EF-A-snapshot-durability.json`.
- The EF proof script creates a selected provider-backed Book Spread order, then mutates current market/outcome labels, selector-like defaults, and provider metadata to moneyline/default-looking values before reading Portfolio/history. The local run was blocked by missing `DATABASE_URL`; focused route/helper tests cover the durability assertions in this worktree.
- Focused route tests now assert open orders, filled positions, canceled history, and recent trades keep the selected Spread/line/period/provider token snapshot and do not fall back to mutated moneyline/current metadata.
- No mobile source, mobile scripts, Prisma schema, or migration files were changed.

## Cycle EB-A - Live Detail Selector And Selected Chart Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live game selected market/line selector | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `markets[].selection.selectorKey`, `marketId`, `marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupId`, `marketGroupTitle`, `marketType`, `marketFamily`, `displayLabel`, `period`, `line`, `lineValue`, `unit`, `outcomes[]` | `Event`, `Market`, active `Outcome` | None in the route contract. UI fixtures, when used, should match this shape exactly. | Event-level sibling selector breadth is still limited to compact markets returned by the route. |
| Selected market chart state | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `markets[].chartHistory[]`, `markets[].chartHistoryStatus`, `markets[].selection.chart.targetMarketId`, `status`, `source`, `pointCount`, `outcomeCount`, `range`, `ranges`, `emptyState` | `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` keyed by compact `marketId`/`outcomeId` | None. Empty history is represented as `selection.chart.status=unavailable` and `emptyState=no-history`. | Real CLOB history for line-family markets requires mapped Polymarket token IDs or an explicitly optional enrichment source. |

Cycle EB-A implementation notes:

- The live-detail response now carries a backend-owned `selection` block per compact market so mobile can change selected market, period, line, and chart state without constructing UI-only selector structures.
- `scripts/probe_mobile_live_detail_route.ts` now fails its route proof if any compact market lacks a matching `selection.marketId`, selector key containing the market id, or chart target matching the market id.
- No schema change was required. Existing `Market` fields (`marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupTitle`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `unit`), active `Outcome` rows, provider outcome fields, and `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` rows cover the contract.

## Cycle EU - Route-Backed Retail Ticket Flow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend event open for Local MVP retail ticket | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug from deep link `forceBackendEventSlug` | `event.title`, `event.liveDataStatus`, `markets[].id`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, `referenceSource`, `externalMarketId`, `conditionId`, `outcomes[].id`, `outcomes[].referenceTokenId`, `outcomes[].referenceOutcomeLabel`, `outcomes[].price/bestBid/bestAsk` | `Event`, `Market`, active `Outcome`, provider quote/depth/history snapshots for proof event | None for spread/totals in EU proof. If a matching backend line is absent, mobile falls back to deterministic contract-shaped fixture and the row is not counted as route-backed. | Team-total provider rows are not covered by the disposable EU route event. |
| Local MVP fake-token order from route-backed ticket | Local mobile mock order path using backend-shaped ticket selection | Client-side mock | No auth for MVP fake-token order | Ticket amount/side plus market/outcome/selection identity | Portfolio cards consume order-time selection fields generated from backend market/outcome fallback metadata | Mobile local state only for EU order/Portfolio proof | This is intentional for the Local MVP. Market data is server-backed, order placement is mock/fake-token. | Server order lifecycle for this exact retail path remains a later milestone when fake-token order APIs are promoted. |

Cycle EU implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EU-local-mvp-route-ticket-flow/cycle-EU-route-backed-retail-event.json`.
- Backend proof artifact slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-4f35da22`; tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-b917234c`.
- Mobile launched against `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE` unset, proving server market data plus mock fake-token trading.
- `full-game` backend line periods are treated as retail `Reg. Time`; `first-half` and `second-half` remain distinct and period-safe.

## Cycle EV - Route-Backed Server Order Flow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |

If a backend line is absent, deterministic fixtures are not accepted as EV P0 evidence. | Production active-event provider line-family breadth remains incomplete. |
| Local MVP fake-token order from route-backed ticket | `/api/orders` via mobile order service | POST | Mobile dev API key with order write scope; backend local flags `INTERNAL_TRADING_BETA_ENABLED=true` and `TRADING_KILL_SWITCH=false` | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, `contractSide`, and `selection` with `marketType=spread`, line `1.5`, period `Reg. Time`, provider source/market/condition/token identity | Order response success plus order identity; mobile transitions to Portfolio after submit | `ApiKey`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. EV runs with `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`. | Filled lifecycle/history for this exact route-backed retail path remains follow-up. |
| Server Portfolio sync after route-backed order | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Same mobile dev API key with account read scope | None | `openOrders[]`, `openOrders[].selection`, open order count, side, label, provider source/token, line, period | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, optional `Position` if filled later | None. EV requires `Server portfolio synced`. | Longer activity/history proof beyond open order is not covered in EV. |

Cycle EV implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EV-local-mvp-route-server-order-flow/cycle-EV-route-backed-retail-event.json`.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-5f9e2d3f`.
- Mobile launched against `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`, proving server market data plus server fake-token order placement.
- The proof uses LAN backend URL `http://172.16.200.14:3002` because wireless tablet ADB reverse/localhost is unreliable for this device.

## Cycle EW - Route-Backed Server Cancel And Activity Flow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Route-backed server order cancel | `/api/orders/:id` | DELETE | Mobile dev API key with order cancel scope; backend local flags `INTERNAL_TRADING_BETA_ENABLED=true` and `TRADING_KILL_SWITCH=false` | Order id from server open order row | Cancel response status; mobile then refreshes Portfolio state | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, user balance/locked funds | None. EW runs with `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`. | Filled lifecycle for this retail path remains follow-up. |
| Server Portfolio/history sync after cancel | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Same mobile dev API key with account read scope | None | `openOrders[]` count drops, `canceledOrders[]` maps into mobile activity with selected spread/provider identity | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. EW requires `Server portfolio synced` and Android-visible canceled activity. | Recent filled trade history is not covered in EW. |

Cycle EW implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-EW-local-mvp-route-server-cancel-flow/cycle-EW-route-backed-retail-event.json`.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-35441a1a`.
- Mobile launched against `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`, then used the visible Portfolio Cancel control to hit server cancel.
- The proof uses LAN backend URL `http://172.16.200.14:3002`.

## Cycle FA - Route-Backed Retail Status States

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Route-backed retail status event | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug from deep link `forceBackendEventSlug` | `event.liveDataStatus`, `markets[].availability.source/status/marketStatus/reason`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, provider source/market/condition/token fields, outcome prices | `Event`, `Market`, active `Outcome`, provider quote/depth/history snapshots | None for FA proof. The route creates provider-backed ready/stale/unavailable states. | Production active-event stale/unavailable status breadth still needs real mapped Polymarket data. |
| Provider-status disposable setup | `scripts/prove_mobile_ej_a_provider_status_breadth.ts` | Local script/route handler call | Local development only | Output path | Creates disposable live event and reads `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` to verify ready, stale, unavailable route states | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `ReferenceOrderbookDepthSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | None. Disposable provider-shaped data is used as contract proof data. | This is not production provider ingestion. |
| Simple TradeTicket status rendering | Mobile local component state from selected route market | N/A | N/A | Selected market/outcome from EventDetail | `ticket.market.availability.status`, `reason`, provider identity, line/period/marketType | No additional backend model | None. The ticket reads route-shaped selected market data. | Backend order rejection for unavailable provider markets should be hardened separately. |

Cycle FA implementation notes:

- `availability.source=provider-lifecycle` is now emitted for provider-backed stale/unavailable compact markets.
- Mobile launched with `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE` unset, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_ORDERBOOK` unset.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-ej-a-provider-status-breadth-6b9b3845`.

## Cycle FB - Provider Unavailable Order Guard

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server fake-token order on provider-backed ticket | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile/API credential with `orders:write`; internal trading gate enabled | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side`, `type`, `price`, `size`, optional `contractSide`, and `selection` | Success path unchanged; unavailable path returns/stores `{ error: { code: "MARKET_UNAVAILABLE" } }` with HTTP `409` | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `Order` only on accepted path | None. Provider-backed unavailable markets require provider quote data. | Future: expose this server rejection in mobile only if a submit bypass/error path becomes visible. |
| Provider quote tradability guard | Latest `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` for market/outcome | Internal Prisma read | Backend only | Selected `marketId` and `outcomeId` from order payload | `acceptingOrders`, `reason`, `fetchedAt`, provider identity on `Market` | `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, provider identity fields on `Market` | Non-provider markets keep existing local behavior. | Production provider refresh breadth must keep quote snapshots fresh for real active events. |

## Cycle FC - Route-Backed Event Discovery Cards

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home/Search/Live World Cup discovery | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1` | GET | Public viewing | None | `events[].slug`, title/team/status/live clock fields, `marketCount`, `activeMarketCount`, and opt-in `events[].markets[]` compact market data | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, quote/depth read models via `serializeMarketReadModel` | Mobile keeps local World Cup fixtures if backend discovery fails or returns no usable markets. | Production active Polymarket event breadth remains P1. |
| Compact route-backed event card markets | `events[].markets[]` from `/api/events` opt-in payload | GET payload field | Public viewing | Query param `includeMobileMarkets=1` | `id`, `marketGroupKey`, `marketGroupTitle`, `marketType`, `period`, `line`, provider source/market/condition/token fields, outcomes, best bid/ask, price | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, orderbook pricing read model | None for returned events; no ad hoc frontend-only market structure is created. | The route currently returns compact market data, not full event-detail chart/live stats. Detail route still owns rich game-page data. |

Cycle FC implementation notes:

- Mobile discovery no longer sends a default text search for `World Cup`; structured `sportKey=soccer` and `leagueKey=world_cup` prevent valid team-titled World Cup events from being hidden.
- Tablet evidence proves the route-backed disposable event `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-e0acffe0` appears on Home with compact outcomes and no default orderbook UI.

## Cycle FD - Route Discovery Opens Route-Backed Event Detail

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home/Search/Live discovery card entry | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1` | GET | Public viewing | None | `events[].slug`, `events[].id`, `events[].title`, status/live clock fields, compact `events[].markets[]`, outcome labels/prices, provider source markers | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | If the event list route fails or has no usable markets, mobile still has local fixtures as fallback. FD proof requires the route-backed card. | Production active Polymarket World Cup breadth remains P1. |
| Event Detail hydration from discovery card | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event id/slug from the selected discovery event | Full event title/status, chart/probability fields, Game Lines market groups, market/outcome identity, provider source/market/condition/token fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, chart history snapshots | If hydration fails, the compact event remains selected; FD proof requires successful same-event route hydration. | A later cycle should prove the same Home-opened event through Buy/Sell ticket, server fake-token order, and Portfolio/history. |

Cycle FD implementation notes:

- `openEventDetail` uses the compact discovery event for instant navigation, then hydrates the same event through the live-detail route when server market-data mode is active.
- This cycle does not add or expose orderbook, chat, live stats, deposit, location, or social routes.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-de83f85d`.

## Cycle FE - Home Route Event Opens Simple Ticket

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home card entry to ticket-ready Event Detail | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1` | GET | Public viewing | None | Event slug/id/title/status, compact markets/outcomes, provider source markers | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | FE proof requires the route-backed card. Local fixtures remain only as app fallback. | Production active Polymarket World Cup breadth remains P1. |
| Spread ticket opened from Home-opened detail | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event id/slug from Home card | Chart/probability fields, Game Lines, `marketType=spread`, line `1.5`, period mapped to `Reg. Time`, outcome id, provider source, provider token | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, chart history snapshots | No arbitrary frontend-only data. The ticket consumes route-shaped market/outcome identity. | Submit/Portfolio proof from this Home-opened path remains follow-up. |

Cycle FE implementation notes:

- No route or schema changes were made.
- The same backend contract from FD now proves the next visible user step: selected Spread outcome -> simple ticket.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-3eeba606`.

## Cycle FF - Home Route Ticket Submit And Portfolio History

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home card entry to fake-token order | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1`, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | None for event list; event id/slug for detail | Event title/status, chart/probability, Game Lines, selected Spread market/outcome identity, provider source/token | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | FE/FF use local mock fake-token order state after route-backed market selection. | Production active Polymarket event breadth remains P1. |
| Fake-token order and Portfolio/history from Home-opened ticket | Mobile local mock order path | Client state | No auth for MVP fake-token order | Ticket amount `$25`, side `buy`, contract side `yes`, and selected Spread identity | Portfolio/latest order/latest activity/position consume order-time selected identity and fake-token status | Mobile local state only for FF order/Portfolio proof | Intentional Local MVP mock mode. | Server order mode for this exact Home-opened path remains follow-up. |

Cycle FF implementation notes:

- No route or schema changes were made.
- FF uses route-backed market data, then local fake-token order state.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-ad48c541`.

## Cycle FG - Home Route Server Order And Portfolio Open Order

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home card entry to server fake-token order | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1`, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | None for event list; event id/slug for detail | Event title/status, chart/probability, Game Lines, selected Spread market/outcome identity, provider source/token | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | FG proof requires the route-backed card. Local fixtures remain only as app fallback. | Production active Polymarket event breadth remains P1. |
| Server fake-token order submit from Home-opened ticket | `/api/orders` | POST | Temporary mobile dev API credential with order scope | Ticket amount `$25`, side `buy`, order type/price/size, selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, contract side `yes`, and selected Spread metadata | Order success state and Portfolio navigation after submit | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider snapshot/read-model fields | None for FG. The order submit uses server mode. | Filled/cancel lifecycle from the exact Home-opened path remains P1. |
| Server Portfolio/history sync after Home-opened order | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Same mobile dev API key with account read scope | None | `latest-order-card`, `portfolio-open-order-count`, open order row, market type `spread`, line `1.5`, period `Reg. Time`, provider source/token | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, portfolio/history read models | None for FG. Portfolio is server-synced. | Production active-event provider liquidity remains follow-up. |

Cycle FG implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-FG-home-route-server-order/cycle-FG-home-route-server-order-event.json`.
- A temporary mobile dev credential was created by `npm run mobile:dev-credential`.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-61978ca5`.
- Mobile launched with `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`, and a real in-process mobile API key.

## Cycle FH - Home Route Server Cancel And Portfolio Activity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home card entry to cancelable server order | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1`, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | None for event list; event id/slug for detail | Event title/status, chart/probability, Game Lines, selected Spread market/outcome identity, provider source/token | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | FH proof requires the route-backed card. Local fixtures remain only as app fallback. | Production active Polymarket event breadth remains P1. |
| Server fake-token order submit from Home-opened ticket | `/api/orders` | POST | Temporary mobile dev API credential with order scope | Ticket amount `$25`, side `buy`, order type/price/size, selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, contract side `yes`, and selected Spread metadata | Order success state and Portfolio navigation after submit | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider snapshot/read-model fields | None for FH. The order submit uses server mode. | Filled lifecycle from the exact Home-opened path remains P1. |
| Server order cancel from Portfolio | `/api/orders/:id` | DELETE | Same mobile dev API key with order cancel scope | Order id from visible open order row | Canceled state via refreshed Portfolio/history, `activity-canceled`, `status-canceled`, selected market metadata | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, portfolio/history read models | None for FH. The cancel uses server mode. | Production active-event provider liquidity remains follow-up. |
| Server Portfolio/history sync after cancel | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Same mobile dev API key with account read scope | None | `latest-activity-card`, canceled activity row, market type `spread`, line `1.5`, period `Reg. Time`, provider source/token | `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, portfolio/history read models | None for FH. Portfolio/history is server-synced. | Production active-event provider liquidity remains follow-up. |

Cycle FH implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-FH-home-route-server-cancel/cycle-FH-home-route-server-cancel-event.json`.
- A temporary mobile dev credential was created by `npm run mobile:dev-credential`.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-4f7f2397`.
- Mobile launched with `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`, and a real in-process mobile API key.

## Cycle FI - Home Route Server Filled Position And Activity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home card entry to fillable server order | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1`, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | None for event list; event id/slug for detail | Event title/status, chart/probability, Game Lines, selected Spread market/outcome identity, provider source/token | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | FI proof requires the route-backed card. Local fixtures remain only as app fallback. | Production active Polymarket event breadth remains P1. |
| Server fake-token order submit from Home-opened ticket | `/api/orders` | POST | Temporary mobile dev API credential with order scope | Ticket amount `$25`, side `buy`, order type/price/size, selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, contract side `yes`, and selected Spread metadata | Filled order state and Portfolio navigation after submit | `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider snapshot/read-model fields | None for FI. The order submit uses server mode and fills against seeded liquidity. | Production active-event provider liquidity remains follow-up. |
| Counterparty liquidity seed for fill proof | `scripts/seed_mobile_route_spread_counterparty.ts` | Local script/Prisma write | Local development only | Event slug, optional market group/outcome/price/size | Creates a maker SELL order at `0.52` for the selected route-backed spread outcome | `User`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. This is deterministic backend-shaped proof liquidity. | Replace with real production liquidity/provider depth when active event breadth is ready. |
| Server Portfolio/history sync after fill | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Same mobile dev API key with account read scope | None | `latest-order-card`, `latest-activity-card`, `position-card-`, `status-filled`, filled shares, exec price, market type `spread`, line `1.5`, period `Reg. Time`, provider source/token | `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome`, portfolio/history read models | None for FI. Portfolio/history is server-synced. | Production active-event provider liquidity remains follow-up. |

Cycle FI implementation notes:

- The backend route event was created by `scripts/prove_mobile_el_a_provider_breadth.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-FI-home-route-server-filled/cycle-FI-home-route-server-filled-event.json`.
- Counterparty liquidity was created by `scripts/seed_mobile_route_spread_counterparty.ts` into `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-FI-home-route-server-filled/cycle-FI-home-route-server-filled-counterparty.json`.
- A temporary mobile dev credential was created by `npm run mobile:dev-credential`.
- Tablet proof slug: `mobile-el-a-provider-breadth-0ca8dfb3`.
- Mobile launched with `EXPO_PUBLIC_MARKET_DATA_MODE=server`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`, and a real in-process mobile API key.

## Cycle FU - Portfolio Value History Backend Route

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio performance chart range data | `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=1D|1W|1M|All` | GET | Session user or mobile API key with `account:read` | Query param `range`; defaults to `1D` when omitted | `range`, `ranges`, `source=portfolio-value-history-route`, `status`, `generatedAt`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `points[].timestamp/value/cash/positionsValue/pnl` | `UserBalance`, `Position`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Standalone mobile still has deterministic fallback data with the same response shape until route wiring is enabled. | Persisted account-level value snapshots remain future work; this route reconstructs value history from market outcome snapshots and current wallet/position state. |

Cycle FU implementation notes:

- The route reuses the same auth model as `/api/portfolio`.
- Invalid ranges return `400` before account state queries.
- Empty accounts return `status=empty`, `emptyState=no-history`, and no points.
- No orderbook, deposit, withdraw, chat, live stats, or social behavior was added.

## Cycle LI - Inactive Futures Surface Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Visible Home match list | `/api/events?includeMobileMarkets=1` in server market-data mode | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/cursor/page size | Event identity, status, teams, compact markets/outcomes, market profile/rules for Home card outcome selection | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model event fields | Existing local `worldCupEvents` remains standalone fallback. | Production active provider breadth remains P1. |
| Old Home Futures tab/list/chart | None after LI | N/A | N/A | N/A | None; the inactive surface was removed from visible app wiring | None for visible MVP | No visible fallback; stale local chart/stat invention removed from source | If Futures browsing returns, backend must own catalog, ordering, quotes, outcome volume/liquidity, and YES/NO contract ids. |

Cycle LI implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema change was required.
- The cleanup narrows visible Home to match/event routes that already have backend contracts.
- Local futures mock data can still support legacy position target lookup and proof fixtures, but no Home Futures browsing surface is exposed.

## Cycle LJ - MVP Backend Readiness Gate

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MVP route readiness inventory | Existing visible MVP route set: `/api/events`, `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail`, `/api/events/:slug/markets`, `/api/markets/:id/quote`, `/api/orders`, `/api/orders/:id`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history`, `/api/portfolio/value-history`, `/api/account/balance`, `/api/profile/summary`, `/api/profile/preferences` | GET/POST/DELETE/PUT as documented per route | Public for event discovery/detail where applicable; account/order routes require canonical mobile API/session scopes | Same as each route contract | Event pages, Game Lines, quotes, order submit/cancel state, Portfolio state/history/chart, account summary/preferences | Existing `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Fill`, `Position`, `Trade`, `UserBalance`, `UserProfilePreference`, snapshot/read-model tables | Mock/offline mode remains. Server-mode Home no longer renders bundled event fallback after route failure; Portfolio value-history route failure remains visible; server cancel waits for backend success. | Public launch still needs production provider breadth, real liquidity, public auth/session/funding/compliance, and dedicated cashout preview/proceeds semantics. |

Cycle LJ implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema change was required.
- LJ turns the full MVP readiness audit into a proof gate and hardens the main server-mode masking risks discovered by the audit.
- Internal local readiness is limited to fake-token/internal server-mode MVP flows.

## Cycle LN - Match Line Service Readiness

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home match event with line markets | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event slug/title/status, `marketProfile=regulation_90`, compact `markets[]` with `marketType`, `marketGroupTitle`, `line`, `period`, outcomes, prices | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | No frontend-only fallback added. Local seed writes backend-shaped contract rows. | Real Polymarket match line-market discovery/attachment remains P1. |
| Event Detail line market route | `/api/mobile/events/switzerland-vs-colombia/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | 7 route markets after LN: Regulation Winner, Spread, Totals, Team Totals; outcome ids/token ids/prices; chart/provider lifecycle metadata where available | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Contract-fixture line markets are marked `referenceSource=contract-fixture`. | Replace contract-fixture line rows with Polymarket-backed rows when available. |
| Local MVP line-market readiness seed | `scripts/seed_mobile_mvp_match_line_markets.ts` | Local script/Prisma write | Local development only | `--eventSlug`, optional `--summaryPath` | Proof JSON with before/after route market types and groups | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | Intended temporary bridge for local MVP UI proof. | Production provider breadth and real liquidity remain outside this cycle. |

Cycle LN implementation notes:

- Before LN, `switzerland-vs-colombia` and `argentina-vs-egypt` only served `match_winner_1x2`.
- `mobile-fj-real-world-cup-winner` is provider-backed but is a futures/outright surface, not a match-betting line surface.
- LN enriches the live match path only and keeps futures as a separate surface.

## Cycle LO - Enriched Match Line Order Lifecycle

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Simple Buy ticket for enriched match Spread | `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical mobile API key with `orders:write`; internal trading beta enabled for local proof user | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side=BUY`, `type=LIMIT`, `price=0.52`, `size=10`, `contractSide=YES`, and `selection` snapshot for Spread line `1.5` | Order id/status/fills, filled order selection, balance, position | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `UserBalance` | None in LO. The proof uses the real order route and matching service. | S23 visible ticket proof remains open. Production line liquidity remains open. |
| Filled Portfolio position after enriched match line BUY | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Canonical mobile API key with `account:read` | None | Filled `positions[]` with selected market/outcome, line `1.5`, period `regulation`, provider/source fields, reference token id | `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in LO. Server route is source of truth. | Public provider-backed line data remains P1. |
| Recent trade activity after enriched match line BUY | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Canonical mobile API key with `account:read` | None | `recentTrades[]` selection preserving Spread identity, line, period, source, token | `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None in LO. Server route is source of truth. | S23 Portfolio/history visible proof remains P0. |
| Maker liquidity for local fill proof | Matching service via `scripts/prove_mobile_mvp_match_line_order_lifecycle.ts` | Local script/Prisma write | Local development only | Market/outcome, ask price `0.52`, ask size `25` | Creates a resting SELL order so the mobile-style BUY fills | `User`, `UserBalance`, collateral/position/order/trade tables | Deterministic backend liquidity only; not frontend mock state. | Replace with production liquidity/provider depth before public readiness. |

Cycle LO implementation notes:

- LO is a server-mode lifecycle pass, not a device Audit Gate pass.
- ADB showed no attached devices, and the S23 wireless debug hostname did not resolve, so Android proof remains the next P0.

## Cycle LP - Provider Match Line Availability

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail provider availability audit | Polymarket Gamma `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fifwc-che-col-2026-07-07` | GET | Public provider API | Exact provider event slug | Provider event title, market ids, market slugs, questions, condition ids | None directly; compared against local `Event.externalSlug` and market mapping fields | None. This is a provider inspection. | Gamma exposes only Regulation Winner markets for the selected event; no provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Totals are available through this surface. |
| Holiwyn Event Detail route comparison | `/api/mobile/events/switzerland-vs-colombia/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `markets[]` with `marketType`, `marketGroupTitle`, `line`, `period`, `referenceSource`, `externalMarketId` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model quote fields | Contract-fixture line markets are allowed for Local MVP UI/order proof when the exact Polymarket event has no real line markets. | Replace fixture line rows with real provider mappings when available. |

Cycle LP implementation notes:

- No schema or order-route change was required.
- `Regulation Winner` is real Polymarket-backed data for the selected match.
- `Spread`, `Totals`, and `Team Totals` are route-visible only through backend-shaped `contract-fixture` rows.
- `OPTIC_ODDS_API_KEY` remains optional and is not a blocker for this Polymarket-first MVP path.

## Cycle LQ - Market Source Summary Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home event source readiness | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters and page size | `events[].marketSourceSummary.totalMarketCount`, `sourceBreakdown`, `regulationWinner.status`, `lineMarkets.status`, `lineMarkets.families`, `lineMarkets.reason` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` source/mapping fields | None added. Existing contract fixtures remain backend rows. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |
| Event Detail source readiness | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `event.marketSourceSummary`, `contract.marketSourceSummary`; same source/family/status fields as Home | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` source/mapping fields | None added. Existing contract fixtures remain backend rows. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |

Cycle LQ implementation notes:

- No schema migration was required.
- The summary is derived from existing `referenceSource`, `marketType`, `marketGroupKey`, and `marketGroupTitle` fields.
- Home and Event Detail now expose the same source-readiness classification for the selected MVP match.

## Cycle LR - Portfolio Selection Source Summary

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio position/open-order source readiness | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Session user or mobile API key with `account:read` | None | `selectionSourceSummary.positions`, `selectionSourceSummary.openOrders`, `selectionSourceSummary.combined`; section source counts and line-market status/families | `Position`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. Summary derives from stored order selection snapshots and market/outcome fallback fields. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |
| Portfolio recent-trade/cancel source readiness | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Session user or mobile API key with `account:read` | None | `selectionSourceSummary.recentTrades`, `selectionSourceSummary.canceledOrders`, `selectionSourceSummary.combined`; section source counts and line-market status/families | `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. Summary derives from stored order selection snapshots and market/outcome fallback fields. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |

Cycle LR implementation notes:

- No schema migration was required.
- Portfolio/history selection summaries classify the same line-market source that was submitted through the ticket.
- The LR proof shows a contract-fixture Spread order becomes a contract-fixture Portfolio position and contract-fixture recent trade.

## Cycle LT - Home To Portfolio Route Journey

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home MVP event selection | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event slug/title, `marketSourceSummary`, compact market rows | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, source/read-model fields | None added. Existing contract-fixture line rows remain backend rows. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |
| Event Detail line selection | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug from Home | Event source summary, line-market row, outcome identity, token/source ids | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, quote/chart/read-model fields | None added. Existing contract-fixture line rows remain backend rows. | Real provider-backed line markets remain absent for selected Gamma event. |
| Fake-token Buy submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Canonical mobile API key with order scope | Selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, BUY side, LIMIT price/size, and line-market `selection` snapshot | Filled order status and preserved selection identity | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Deterministic maker liquidity is seeded for local proof. | Production liquidity remains future work. |
| Portfolio proof after Home-selected trade | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Canonical mobile API key with `account:read` | None | Filled position, recent trade, `selectionSourceSummary`, selected line/source/token identity | `Position`, `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. Route proof uses real server state. | S23 visible proof remains open. |

Cycle LT implementation notes:

- The proof starts from the public Home route rather than direct database lookup.
- The selected Event Detail line market, order request, Portfolio position, and History trade all preserve `referenceSource=contract-fixture`.
- S23 was visible during the cycle but visual Android proof was intentionally left for the next UI Audit Gate cycle.

## Cycle LU - Current State Inspection And Home MVP Feed Tightening

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home MVP match feed | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size; mobile now passes `leagueKey=world_cup` | Match `slug`, `title`, `eventType`, `sportKey`, `leagueKey`, live/status fields, compact Regulation Winner outcomes, `marketSourceSummary` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | Server-mode Home still clears events instead of rendering bundled fallback if the route fails. | Backend route can still return futures; mobile filters to match events for Local MVP. |
| Event Detail source inspection | `/api/mobile/events/switzerland-vs-colombia/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `event.marketSourceSummary`, market rows, `referenceSource`, `marketType`, line/period/outcome identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | Contract-fixture line rows remain backend-written Local MVP bridge data. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows are not attached for the selected Gamma event. |

Cycle LU implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema change was required.
- Mobile Home feed now asks for `leagueKey=world_cup` and drops non-match/futures provider records.
- S23 proof used Expo Go because the installed `com.holiwyn.mobile` package is stale and still shows older local Home UI.

## Cycle LV - Event Detail Layout Tightening

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail visible chart and line-market layout | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug selected from Home | Event title/teams/status, primary market outcomes, `chartHistory`, market `marketType`, `marketGroupTitle`, `line`, `period`, outcome probabilities, source identity fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model quote fields | No new mock added. Existing backend-written `contract-fixture` line rows are rendered when provider line markets are absent. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total markets remain absent for `switzerland-vs-colombia`. |

Cycle LV implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema changed.
- The mobile page now consumes the existing Event Detail route in a denser Polymarket-like layout.
- The chart uses route `chartHistory` when present and falls back to deterministic display points from current probabilities.

## Cycle LW - S23 Line Ticket To Portfolio History Flow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spread line Buy submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key with `orders:write`; internal trading beta enabled | `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `side=BUY`, `type=LIMIT`, price/size derived from `$25` at `52%`, line-market `selection` snapshot | Order response status, filled/open order fields, resulting Portfolio refresh | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `UserBalance` | None added. Existing backend-shaped `contract-fixture` line row selected from Event Detail. | Runtime deep-link API-key injection is unreliable in current Expo Go session; Expo env startup path is required for proof. |
| Portfolio after line Buy | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Mobile dev API key with `account:read` | None | Position title/outcome, cost, to-win, entry probability, cash/value totals | `Position`, `Order`, `Trade`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. Route-backed Portfolio state shown on S23. | None for local fake-token MVP proof. |
| History after line Buy | `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Mobile dev API key with `account:read` | None | Recent trade/activity row with event, line, side, amount, timestamp | `Trade`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None. Route-backed History state shown on S23. | None for local fake-token MVP proof. |

Cycle LW implementation notes:

- `/api/orders` correctly rejected unauthenticated mobile submit with `Authentication required`.
- With the dev API key loaded into the Expo process environment, the same S23 flow submitted and appeared in Portfolio/history.

## Cycle LX - Local MVP S23 Startup Harness

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local MVP S23 proof startup | `/api/health` and Expo `/status` | GET | Public | None | Backend health availability and Expo packager status | None | None | None for startup; proof still requires generated mobile dev API key for authenticated routes. |
| Mobile dev credential generation | Local `scripts/create_mobile_dev_credential.ts` | Local script | Local development database access | Optional env overrides for username/balance/policy | Redacted credential metadata, configured API key status | `User`, `UserBalance`, `ApiCredential`, ledger deposit records | Fake-token local balance top-up to 10000 USDT equivalent | Production auth/session model remains outside local MVP proof scope. |

Cycle LX implementation notes:

- No API route or schema changed.
- Startup now makes the server-mode mobile proof dependency explicit instead of relying on fragile runtime deep-link API-key injection.

## Cycle LY - Portfolio Chart Containment

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio header chart/range display | `/api/portfolio` and `/api/portfolio/value-history?range=1D` | GET | Mobile dev API key with `account:read` when server mode is active | None | Portfolio balance/positions plus value-history `points`, `range`, `source`, and `status` | `UserBalance`, `Position`, portfolio value history read model | Deterministic value history remains the fallback if route history is unavailable. | None for chart containment; broader production value-history richness remains P1. |

Cycle LY implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema changed.
- The UI now constrains route/fallback value-history points to the visual chart band before the range selector.

## Cycle LZ - Current State Reinspection And Portfolio Account Entry

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Local MVP route inspection | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` and `/api/mobile/events/switzerland-vs-colombia/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters and event slug | Event/match list, `eventType`, `marketSourceSummary`, `markets[].referenceSource`, `marketType`, `line`, `period` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | Existing backend `contract-fixture` line rows remain visible when provider lines are absent. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Totals are not attached for the selected Gamma event. |
| Provider line availability confirmation | Polymarket Gamma `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fifwc-che-col-2026-07-07` | GET | Public provider API | Exact provider event slug | Provider market ids, slugs, questions, condition ids, derived market-family count | Compared to local `Event.externalSlug`, `Market.externalMarketId`, `Market.referenceSource` | None; this is provider inspection only. | Gamma exposes 0 checked line-market families for this event. |
| Portfolio account entry | Existing `AccountScreen` tab state | Local navigation | No new route | Tap Portfolio top-left profile/avatar | Existing Account screen props already loaded by App state and profile/account routes when available | No new database dependency | None | No backend route is required for the navigation change. |

Cycle LZ implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema changed.
- `mobile:mvp:inspect` now exists for repeatable Local MVP route inspection.
- Portfolio account entry is frontend navigation only; account data dependencies remain the existing Account screen routes.

## Cycle MA - Argentina vs Egypt Line Fixtures And Detail Hydration

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home match feed inspection | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Match `slug`, `title`, `eventType`, compact `markets`, `marketSourceSummary`, line families | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | Mobile filters out futures and does not invent Home matches in server mode. | Route still includes a future record; mobile filters it for Local MVP. |
| Argentina vs Egypt detail hydration | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | 7 markets, `marketSourceSummary`, market `referenceSource`, `marketType`, `marketGroupTitle`, `line`, `period`, outcome prices, condition/token/source fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, local orderbook quote snapshots | Existing backend-written `contract-fixture` lines are consumed for Local MVP UI proof. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total markets are absent for the inspected Polymarket match. |
| Local MVP line fixture seeding | `scripts/seed_mobile_mvp_match_line_markets.ts` | Local script | Local development database access | `--eventSlug`, `--cycle`, `--summaryPath` | Writes backend-shaped line markets and quote snapshots; proof reads route back | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | This creates contract-shaped line rows only when provider-backed rows are unavailable. | Replace with provider-backed line ingestion when approved provider rows exist. |

Cycle MA implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- No order route behavior changed.
- Event Detail now uses `event.slug ?? event.id` for hydration, matching the mobile live-detail route contract.

## Cycle MB - Current MVP Inspection, Swipe Submit, And S23 Flow

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Home route inspection | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event slug/title/type/status, compact markets, `marketSourceSummary` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | None added. Existing contract-fixture rows are returned from backend. | Route still includes one future; mobile filters it for Local MVP match flow. |
| Event Detail line market proof | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | 7 markets, provider-backed Regulation Winner, contract-fixture line markets, selected `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `line`, `period`, source/token/condition identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | Contract-shaped line rows are backend records, not frontend-only random mock data. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows are not available for the inspected Polymarket match. |
| Visible S23 swipe order | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key with order scope | Selected line market/outcome, side, price/size, selection snapshot | Open order/Portfolio refresh; selected line/source identity | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | UI proof lands as open order unless crossing liquidity is available. |
| Portfolio open order and history empty state | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Mobile dev API key with account scope | None | Portfolio cash/open order plus History empty state; selection identity remains present in labels/state | `UserBalance`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | Filled History from visible UI requires seeded/crossing liquidity or a fill path. |

Cycle MB implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- Backend route proof verified a filled order/history using seeded counterparty liquidity.
- S23 visible proof verified the retail open-order path and History empty state after an unfilled order.

## Cycle MC - Visible Filled History For Local MVP Line Ticket

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home MVP match selection | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event slug/title/type/status, compact markets, `marketSourceSummary` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | None added. Existing contract-fixture rows are returned from backend. | Route still includes one future; mobile filters it for Local MVP match flow. |
| Event Detail line market selection | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | 7 markets, provider-backed Regulation Winner, selected Spread `1.5` line, source/token/condition identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | Contract-shaped line rows are backend records, not frontend-only random mock data. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows are not available for the inspected Polymarket match. |
| Visible S23 filled swipe order | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key with order scope | Selected line market/outcome, BUY side, price/size, selection snapshot | Filled order/Portfolio refresh; selected line/source identity | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Local proof seeds deterministic counterparty liquidity before the S23 submit. | Production liquidity remains future work. |
| Portfolio filled position and history | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Mobile dev API key with account scope | None | Filled position and recent trade row with selected Spread line/source/token identity | `UserBalance`, `Position`, `Trade`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. Routes read real server state after the visible S23 submit. | None for local fake-token MVP proof. |

Cycle MC implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- Proof cleanup cancels only stale automated proof BUY orders on the exact selected market/outcome before seeding maker liquidity.
- S23 visible proof now verifies filled History, closing the prior MB gap where the visible UI landed only on an open order.

## Cycle ME - Event Detail Line Section Clearance

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail Game Lines layout | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | Market group/title, `marketType`, `line`, `period`, outcome probability, source/token/condition identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Existing backend-shaped `contract-fixture` rows are rendered. | Real provider-backed line rows remain unavailable for the inspected match. |
| Visible S23 regression path | `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST/GET | Mobile dev API key for order/account routes | Selected Spread `1.5` BUY selection snapshot | Filled order, refreshed Portfolio position, History trade row | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Local proof seeds deterministic counterparty liquidity before submit. | Production liquidity remains future work. |

Cycle ME implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema changed.
- The API dependency remains the same as Cycle MC; this cycle only improved Event Detail layout/proof stability.

## Cycle MF - Home Compact Feed And Proof Hygiene

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home compact match feed | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event `slug`, `title`, `eventType`, `status`, `sportKey`, `leagueKey`, `homeTeamName`, `awayTeamName`, `liveStatus`, `clock`, `period`, compact markets and outcomes | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | None added. Mobile filters the existing route to active match-like rows only. | Route should eventually return only Local MVP match rows for this view instead of requiring mobile-side future filtering. |
| Event Detail line selection | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | Provider-backed Regulation Winner rows plus backend-shaped Spread/Totals line rows, `marketType`, `line`, `period`, outcome ids/source/price fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | Existing `contract-fixture` line rows remain the local MVP fallback. | Real provider-backed line rows remain unavailable for the inspected Polymarket event. |
| Visible S23 filled swipe order | `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST/GET | Mobile dev API key for order/account routes | Selected Spread `1.5` BUY selection snapshot | Filled order, refreshed Portfolio position, History trade row | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Local proof seeds deterministic counterparty liquidity before submit. | Production liquidity/execution behavior remains future work. |

Cycle MF implementation notes:

- No backend route or schema changed.
- The harness now proves Home is clean before route navigation by dismissing Expo developer-menu overlays.
- Home filtering now avoids treating missing `eventType` as match evidence; match-like fields or live status must be present.

## Cycle MG - Home MVP Match Route Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home Local MVP match feed | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&source=polymarket&includeMobileMarkets=1&mobileMvpMatches=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event `slug`, `title`, `eventType`, `status`, `liveStatus`, team names, compact `markets`, `marketSourceSummary`, `page.nextCursor`, `page.hasMore` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider/read-model fields | None added. Home still has local fallback only if the backend route is unreachable. | None for match-only Home contract. A dedicated mobile Home endpoint remains optional future cleanup. |
| Event Detail line selection | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | Provider-backed Regulation Winner rows plus backend-shaped Spread/Totals line rows, `marketType`, `line`, `period`, selected outcome identity | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, provider quote/read-model fields | Existing `contract-fixture` line rows remain the Local MVP fallback. | Real provider-backed line rows remain unavailable for the inspected Polymarket events. |
| Visible S23 filled swipe order | `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST/GET | Mobile dev API key for order/account routes | Selected Spread `1.5` BUY selection snapshot | Filled order, refreshed Portfolio position, History trade row | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Local proof seeds deterministic counterparty liquidity before submit. | Production liquidity/execution behavior remains future work. |

Cycle MG implementation notes:

- `/api/events` now supports `mobileMvpMatches=1` as an explicit Local MVP Home feed contract.
- Route proof returned 2 active match events and 0 futures.
- No schema migration was added.

## Cycle NK - Current Provider Winner Chart Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Home match feed | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&source=polymarket&includeMobileMarkets=1&mobileMvpMatches=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Current match slug/title plus compact markets and `marketSourceSummary` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | None for current match discovery. |
| Event Detail provider chart | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `event.chartHistory`, `event.chartHistorySource`, `event.chartHistoryStatus`, `event.chartHistoryRange`, `event.chartHistoryLastUpdated`, `contract.batchedChartHistorySource`, market-level `chartHistoryStatus` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Existing synthetic chart drawing remains only a visual fallback when history is empty. | Automated provider refresh scheduling is still separate; this cycle proves the refresh path and route contract. |
| Primary market chart route | `/api/markets/:id/chart?range=1D` | GET | Public viewing plus market visibility guard | Market id/range | `source`, `history`, `lastUpdated`, `emptyState`, `series` | `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Empty route returns `emptyState: no-history`. | None for provider-backed Regulation Winner history after refresh. |
| Provider CLOB history refresh | `scripts/prove_current_match_polymarket_chart_history.ts` -> `refreshPolymarketPriceHistorySnapshots` | Local script/provider fetch | Local development database and public Polymarket CLOB | Event slug, provider-backed market ids | Refresh report, snapshot counts, skipped reasons | `Market`, `Outcome`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | None added. | Freshness depends on provider availability and current market token ids. |
| Visible S23 provider winner order | `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST/GET | Mobile dev API key for order/account routes | Provider-backed Regulation Winner selection snapshot | Filled order, Portfolio position/activity/history with provider source and no line | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Proof seeds deterministic counterparty liquidity. | Production liquidity remains future work. |

Cycle NK implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- `/api/mobile/events/:slug/live-detail` now surfaces route-visible chart source/status fields for mobile proof.
- Current line-market route rows remain `contract-fixture`; this is documented and not claimed as Polymarket-backed parity.

## Cycle NL - Provider Refresh And Local MVP Liquidity

| Mobile feature | API endpoint used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Restore script rebuilds backend records when tests reset DB. | Dedicated provider-owned active match discovery remains future work. |
| Event Detail current match | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | 3 provider-backed Regulation Winner markets, 4 contract-fixture line markets, chart source/status, selection identity fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Backend-shaped line fixtures remain for MVP line UI. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows remain unavailable for this inspected event. |
| Provider quote refresh | `/api/mobile/events/:slug/provider-refresh` via `executeMobileLiveProviderRefreshRoute` | Route/service proof | Local backend/proof context | Event slug, `allowContractProofFallback=false` | Provider refresh status, refreshed/skipped counts, quote lifecycle fields | `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot`, `MarketOutcomeSnapshot` | Optic Odds is optional/unconfigured and non-blocking. | Orderbook depth remains internal and not required for Local MVP. |
| Visible S23 provider winner order | `/api/orders`, `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | POST/GET | Mobile dev API key for order/account routes | Provider-backed Regulation Winner BUY selection snapshot | Filled order, Portfolio position, History activity with provider market/token/source identity | `ApiCredential`, `Order`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Proof seeds deterministic local counterparty liquidity. | Production liquidity/execution behavior remains future work. |

Cycle NL implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- Gamma market refresh now supports grouped soccer event fallback.
- Provider-mapped fake-token orders can execute when Holiwyn has local crossing liquidity even if the old provider book is unavailable.

## Cycle NM - Current Line Ticket S23 Flow

| Server ticket submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key | BUY limit order with selection snapshot for `Egypt +1.5` | Filled order id/status and selection snapshot | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance` | Proof seeds local counterparty liquidity. | Production liquidity remains future work. |
| Portfolio/history confirmation | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Mobile dev API key | None | Position, recent trade, selected line/source identity | `Position`, `Trade`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | None for Local MVP fake-token proof. |

Cycle NM implementation notes:

- No backend route/schema changed.
- The route and S23 proofs validate the current route-backed line-ticket flow after Cycle NL restored service readiness.

## Cycle NN - Current Line Cashout S23 Flow

| Cashout sell submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key | SELL order for the owned `marketId`/`outcomeId`/line with full position size | Filled SELL order/trade, updated position, sold activity | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Trade`, `Position`, `UserBalance` | Proof seeds local BUY counterparty liquidity at a crossing bid. | Production liquidity and price preview hardening remain future work. |
| Portfolio/history confirmation | `/api/portfolio`, `/api/portfolio/history` | GET | Mobile dev API key | None | Position, sold activity, selected line/source identity | `Position`, `Trade`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | None for Local MVP fake-token cashout proof. |

Cycle NN implementation notes:

- No backend route/schema changed.
- The proof confirms the existing backend order route can support the Local MVP sell/cashout path when crossing liquidity exists.

## Cycle NO - Provider Line Fallback Discovery

| Mobile feature | API endpoint/service used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Detail provider discovery | `discoverMobileLiveProviderCandidates()` via provider-candidate scripts/routes | Service / proof script | Local backend context | Event slug, provider search mode, optional provider event slugs | `manualSlugFallbacks`, `providerCandidateFamilySummary`, `targets[].attachProposal`, `targets[].bestCandidate.attachReadiness` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. Existing line fixtures remain explicit route data. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total markets remain unavailable for current event. |
| Current provider line availability | Polymarket Gamma `/events?slug=fifwc-arg-egy-2026-07-07` | GET | Public provider API | Event slug | Provider event markets, family counts, line market count | None directly; compared to local `Event`/`Market`/`Outcome` route data | None added. | Gamma exposes only match-winner markets for this inspected event. |
| Current Event Detail route | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `marketSourceSummary.regulationWinner.status`, `marketSourceSummary.lineMarkets.status`, market source fields | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Backend `contract-fixture` line rows remain. | Provider line ingestion can only attach real lines once attach-ready provider candidates exist. |

Cycle NO implementation notes:

- No backend route/schema changed.
- Discovery now searches line-family exact slug fallbacks and keeps strict attach-readiness gates.

## Cycle NP - Line Family Readiness Contract

| Mobile feature | API endpoint/service used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home current match source disclosure | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&mobileMvpMatches=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | `marketSourceSummary.regulationWinner.status`, `marketSourceSummary.lineMarkets.status`, `lineMarkets.familyReadiness` | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | Real provider-backed line markets remain unavailable for this event. |
| Event Detail source disclosure | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `event.marketSourceSummary.lineMarkets.familyReadiness[]`, family counts/status/reasons, provider availability reason | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | Existing backend `contract-fixture` line rows remain explicit route data. | Provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows are missing until a provider exposes attach-ready markets. |
| Samsung Event Detail proof | `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1 -EventDetailSummary` through `mobile/scripts/smoke-samsung.ps1` | Device smoke | Expo Go/device reachability | Deep-link startup | Event Detail summary labels, game lines, player props, no old stats requirement | None | Uses existing mock Event Detail proof path when backend health check is unavailable. | Server-mode visible proof should be rerun for the next full MVP journey cycle. |

Cycle NP implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- The route now answers which line families are provider-backed vs fixture-backed.
- The proof gate no longer requires old Volume/Liquidity/Traders copy that conflicts with the Local MVP simple event-info direction.

## Cycle NQ - Server-Mode Line Family Readiness Proof

| Mobile feature | API endpoint/service used | Method | Auth requirement | Request body | Response fields consumed by mobile | Database tables/models implied | Mock fallback behavior | Missing backend support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Home/Live match entry | `/api/events?sportKey=soccer&leagueKey=world_cup&includeMobileMarkets=1&limit=10` | GET | Public viewing | Query filters/page size | Event slug/title, compact market source summary, provider winner/local line disclosure | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome` | None added. | Active provider-backed soccer line breadth remains missing. |
| Event Detail line readiness | `/api/mobile/events/argentina-vs-egypt/live-detail` | GET | Public viewing | Event slug | `marketSourceSummary.regulationWinner.status`, `lineMarkets.status`, `lineMarkets.familyReadiness[]`, line market ids/outcome ids/source/line/period | `Event`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `ReferenceQuoteSnapshot` | Existing backend `contract-fixture` line rows for spread, total, and team-total. | Real provider-backed Spread/Totals/Team Total rows are not available for the inspected event. |
| Server ticket submit | `/api/orders` | POST | Mobile dev API key | BUY limit order with `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `marketType=spread`, `line=1.5`, `providerSource=contract-fixture` | Open order id/status and selection snapshot | `ApiCredential`, `ApiOrderRequest`, `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome` | No counterparty liquidity was seeded in this proof; order rests open. | Production liquidity remains future work. |
| Portfolio open-order confirmation | `/api/portfolio` | GET | Mobile dev API key | None | Open order row, market type, line, provider source badge | `Order`, `Market`, `Outcome`, `UserBalance` | None added. | None for current Local MVP open-order proof. |

Cycle NQ implementation notes:

- No schema migration was added.
- No backend route changed.
- This cycle promoted the S23 proof from generic Event Detail smoke to server-mode route proof for the current source/readiness state.
