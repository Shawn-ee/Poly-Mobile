# Mobile Loop State

Current mission: Build Holiwyn, a World Cup-first sports prediction and trading mobile app with English and Simplified Chinese support.

Current phase: Autonomous mobile product development in verified cycles.

Launch mode: Long-running autonomous execution toward final Definition of Done. Phase 0 is the first gate, not the stopping point.

## Active Devices

Samsung S23:

- Purpose: Polymarket reference observation.
- Status: Wireless debugging paired during setup.

Android Emulator:

- Purpose: Holiwyn development and QA.
- Status: Available from prior setup.

## Branch Policy

Use local cycle branches:

- `mobile/cycle-001`
- `mobile/cycle-002`
- `mobile/cycle-003`

Merge each cycle branch locally after verification.

## Harness Policy

Use `docs/mobile/MOBILE_HARNESS_SPEC.md` for repeatable cycle execution.

At cycle start, select required harnesses. Before commit and local merge, record harnesses run and any failures.

When stuck, run the Recovery Harness. The Lead Agent should ask Audit Agent or Reviewer Agent for recommendations and continue without user input unless a hard stop rule is hit.

Every three completed cycles, add a heartbeat summary.

### Cycle 003

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-003
Goal: Add a backend-compatible World Cup data adapter and a repeatable mobile smoke harness while preserving mock fallback and fake-token order behavior.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens; used Cycle 001 reference map and Cycle 003 Reviewer Agent guidance.
Holiwyn screens changed: Home data source can now hydrate from backend event detail responses; visible UI remains the Cycle 002 shell.
Backend/API changed: None. Mobile API query changed to request sports/soccer/world_cup events without LIVE-only filtering.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/api.ts`, `mobile/src/adapters/worldCupAdapter.ts`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `mobile/package.json`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.
- `npm run smoke` in `mobile/`.
- Backend health probe inside smoke harness returned `ok`.
- Emulator launch and screenshot capture via smoke harness.
Screenshots captured:
- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-003-holiwyn-smoke.png`
Bugs found:
- Smoke harness initially failed because PowerShell cannot redirect stdout and stderr to the same file; fixed with separate log files.
- Smoke harness initially failed on bare `npx`; fixed by launching `npx.cmd` on Windows.
- Smoke screenshot path initially pointed one directory above the repo; fixed default output path.
Technical debt added:
- TD-007: Real authenticated order placement is still not wired into the mobile ticket.
Technical debt resolved:
- Partial TD-004 progress: backend event/detail adapter now exists; order adapter remains open.
Result: Passed Cycle 003 QA. App can run with backend-compatible event data when available and mock data when backend data is unavailable, and the emulator smoke flow is now repeatable.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile backend adapter and smoke harness`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 004 should split the large `App.tsx` into focused mobile components or wire a safe order service boundary, choosing the smaller verified slice first.
Harnesses run:
- Backend/API Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- QA Smoke Harness
- Review Harness
- Recovery Harness
Harness failures:
- Three harness implementation issues found and fixed before approval.

### Cycle 004

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-004
Goal: Add a mobile order service boundary so trade tickets remain safe in mock mode while preparing a guarded server order path.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Portfolio position metadata now shows whether an order came from MOCK or SERVER mode.
Backend/API changed: None. Mobile service can call existing `POST /api/orders` only when `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORDER_MODE=server`; default remains mock.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/services/orderService.ts`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.

Bugs found: None in product flow. Smoke harness remained stable.
Technical debt added:
- TD-008: Server order mode exists as a guarded code path but is not verified with authenticated backend access.
Technical debt resolved:
- Partial TD-007 progress: ticket submission now uses a service boundary with mock/server modes; authenticated server mode remains disabled by default.
Result: Passed Cycle 004 QA. Fake-token trading still works and is now isolated behind an order service.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile order service boundary`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 005 should reduce `mobile/App.tsx` size by extracting reusable World Cup components or continue toward authenticated account/position adapter work if backend auth is ready.
Harnesses run:

Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Deep smoke still taps by coordinates even though labels now exist; server order mode remains unverified; localization table remains in `App.tsx`.
Next three likely cycles: Explore selector-based Android harnessing, improve Live tab presentation, and normalize/extract localization copy.

### Cycle 016

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-016
Goal: Improve the Live tab presentation with a focused live screen header, count badge, and live-specific empty state.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Live tab now shows `Live World Cup`, a red count badge, and `No live markets right now.` when no live events are present.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.
- `npm run smoke` in `mobile/`.
- Emulator tap-through to Live tab.
Screenshots captured:
- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-016-holiwyn-smoke.png`
- `docs/mobile/screenshots/cycle-016-holiwyn-live-tab.png`
Bugs found: None.
Technical debt added: None.
Technical debt resolved:
- Live tab no longer uses generic no-results copy.
Result: Passed Cycle 016 QA. Live tab has a clearer user-facing state.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Improve Holiwyn mobile live tab`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 017 should normalize/extract localization copy or add selector-based harness probing.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures: None.

### Cycle 017

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-017
Goal: Harden the Android smoke harness with UI hierarchy evidence and first text-based assertions.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Bottom tab buttons now expose stable `holiwyn-*-tab` accessibility labels/test IDs for future selector harnesses.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `mobile/src/components/BottomTabs.tsx`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.
- `npm run smoke:deep` in `mobile/`.
Screenshots captured:

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-017-holiwyn-ticket.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-017-holiwyn-portfolio.xml`
Bugs found: None.
Technical debt added:
- TD-011: `smoke:deep` still uses coordinate taps; hierarchy assertions now verify landed screens, but taps should eventually use native selectors or a mobile E2E runner.
Technical debt resolved:
- Partial TD-010 progress: smoke now asserts visible Home, Ticket, and Portfolio screen text from Android hierarchy dumps.
Result: Passed Cycle 017 QA. The smoke harness now saves inspectable XML evidence and fails if core visible screen text is missing.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile hierarchy smoke checks`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 018 should use the stronger harness to add Search or Live tab deep smoke coverage.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-018-holiwyn-search.xml`
Bugs found: None.
Technical debt added: None.
Technical debt resolved:
- Partial TD-011 progress: deep smoke now verifies Live and Search after coordinate navigation, reducing blind spots in the tab shell.
Result: Passed Cycle 018 QA. Deep smoke now covers Home, Ticket, Portfolio, Live, and Search.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Extend Holiwyn mobile deep smoke tabs`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 019 should return to product work, likely richer search filtering UX or live market state refresh.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures: None.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 018

Completed cycles: 016, 017, 018 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Live tab presentation is clearer, Android smoke now saves UI hierarchy evidence, and deep smoke covers Home, Ticket, Portfolio, Live, and Search.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has a dark World Cup shell, mock fake-token trading, portfolio state, live/search tabs, stable tab labels, and stronger automated emulator evidence.
Current backend state: Backend health remains `ok`; no schema changes in these cycles.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Deep smoke still taps by coordinates; server order mode remains unverified; localization copy remains in `App.tsx`.
Next three likely cycles: Improve search filtering UX, add richer live-market refresh/state handling, and extract localization copy once encoding is safe.

### Cycle 019

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-019
Goal: Improve Search tab result presentation and recover smoke reliability around app launch/live-state variance.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Search tab now shows a `Top results`/`Results` header, result count, clear button when filtering, and no longer auto-focuses the input on tab open.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-019-holiwyn-live.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-019-holiwyn-search.xml`
Bugs found:
- Search `autoFocus` triggered a stylus/keyboard overlay that hid market cards in the emulator screenshot.
- Live tab hierarchy assertion assumed empty backend-fed state and failed under mock fallback live data.
- App launch occasionally stayed on emulator home before hierarchy assertion.
Technical debt added: None.
Technical debt resolved:
- Search no longer opens with keyboard/stylus overlay.
- Smoke now waits for Holiwyn Home and retries the Expo URL before capturing Home.
- Live smoke accepts either empty live state or visible live-market state.
Result: Passed Cycle 019 QA after Recovery Harness. Search tab is cleaner and deep smoke is more resilient under backend mock fallback.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Improve Holiwyn mobile search results`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 020 should add typed-query search QA or richer market filters.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Recovery Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- Initial `npm run smoke:deep` failed on live empty-state assumption and emulator launch timing; both were fixed and the final run passed.

### Cycle 020

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-020
Goal: Add quick Search filters for World Cup market browsing.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-020-holiwyn-search.xml`
Bugs found: None.
Technical debt added: None.
Technical debt resolved:
- Search can now narrow results by live/upcoming state without requiring typed input.
Result: Passed Cycle 020 QA. Search tab has quick filters and deep smoke asserts the filter labels.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile search filters`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 021 should add typed-query harness coverage or improve live market refresh/state behavior.

Result: Passed Cycle 021 QA. Search remains covered by deep smoke after extraction.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Extract Holiwyn mobile search screen`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 022 should add typed-query Search QA or improve live market refresh/state behavior.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures: None.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 021

Completed cycles: 019, 020, 021 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Search now has result count, clear affordance, quick filters, no keyboard overlay on entry, resilient smoke launch handling, and a dedicated component.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile keeps the World Cup trading shell working with Home, Ticket, Portfolio, Live, and Search covered by deep smoke.
Current backend state: Backend health was unavailable during recent smoke runs, but mock fallback remained verified; no schema changes were made.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Deep smoke still uses coordinate taps; typed-query behavior is not yet explicitly automated; server order mode remains unverified.
Next three likely cycles: Add typed-query Search QA, improve live-market update behavior, and continue component extraction around Home/Featured Future.

### Cycle 022

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-022
Goal: Extract Live tab UI into a dedicated component.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No intended visual changes.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/components/LiveScreen.tsx`, `docs/mobile/`.

Result: Passed Cycle 022 QA. Live tab remains covered by deep smoke after extraction.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Extract Holiwyn mobile live screen`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 023 should add typed-query Search QA or extract Home subcomponents.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures: None.

### Cycle 023

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-023
Goal: Add typed-query Search harness coverage for zero-result filtering.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No intended production UI changes. Smoke mode disables soft input on Search to let ADB text enter the field reliably.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `mobile/src/components/SearchScreen.tsx`, `docs/mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-023-holiwyn-search.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-023-holiwyn-search-query.xml`
Bugs found:
- Android emulator stylus handwriting intercepted ADB text input before the Search field could receive it.
Technical debt added:
- TD-012: Search typed-query smoke uses a smoke-only soft-input flag because emulator handwriting intercepts ADB text.
Technical debt resolved:
- Search deep smoke now proves the query field can enter a zero-result state and show `Clear`.
Result: Passed Cycle 023 QA after Recovery Harness. Search query behavior is now explicitly verified.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile typed search smoke`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 024 should improve live market refresh/state behavior or continue Home component extraction, then write heartbeat after merge.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Recovery Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- Initial typed-query smoke failed because emulator handwriting captured ADB text. Added a smoke-only `EXPO_PUBLIC_SMOKE_DISABLE_SOFT_INPUT` path and reran successfully.

### Cycle 024

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-024
Goal: Add Live tab freshness context and an interactive refresh control.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Live tab now shows `Updated just now`, a `Refresh` control, and changes to `Updated just now · refreshed` after tapping refresh.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/components/LiveScreen.tsx`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.
- `npm run smoke:deep` in `mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-024-holiwyn-search.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-024-holiwyn-search-query.xml`
Bugs found:
- Initial refresh tap coordinate matched the live count instead of proving the refreshed status; corrected with a better tap target and unambiguous `refreshed` assertion.
Technical debt added:
- TD-013: Live refresh is local UI state only; it does not refetch backend/live odds yet.
Technical debt resolved:
- Live tab now communicates freshness and exposes an interactive refresh affordance.
Result: Passed Cycle 024 QA after Recovery Harness. Live tab has refresh context and deep smoke proves the refreshed state.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn mobile live refresh state`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 025 should connect live refresh to real event reload or continue Home component extraction.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Recovery Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- Initial live refresh assertion was too weak because `1` also matched the live count. The assertion now checks `refreshed` after tapping the refresh control.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 024

Completed cycles: 022, 023, 024 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Live screen is extracted, Search typed-query zero-result behavior is verified, and Live now has a refresh status affordance with smoke coverage.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has verified Home, Ticket, Portfolio, Live, Search, typed Search query, and Live refresh interactions under deep smoke.
Current backend state: Backend health was unavailable during recent smoke runs; mock fallback remained verified. No schema changes were made.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Live refresh is local UI state only; deep smoke still relies on coordinate taps; real server order mode remains unverified.
Next three likely cycles: Connect Live refresh to event reload, extract Home screen pieces, and add portfolio P/L or open-order detail.

### Cycle 025

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-025
Goal: Connect Live refresh to the shared backend/mock event reload path.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Live tab refresh now calls the app-level World Cup event loader and keeps the refreshed status after the async reload completes.
Backend/API changed: Mobile API requests now use a 3.5 second timeout so unavailable local backend calls fall back quickly on emulator.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/api.ts`, `mobile/src/components/LiveScreen.tsx`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-025-holiwyn-search.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-025-holiwyn-search-query.xml`
Bugs found:
- Initial deep smoke captured the Live refresh screen while the unreachable emulator backend request was still pending, so the refreshed state had not appeared yet.
Technical debt added:
- None.
Technical debt resolved:
- TD-013: Live refresh now calls the shared event reload path and falls back to mock World Cup events when the backend is unavailable.
Result: Passed Cycle 025 QA after Recovery Harness. Live refresh now performs an async reload instead of only changing local UI state.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Wire Holiwyn live refresh to event reload`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 026 should continue app decomposition by extracting Home screen pieces or deepen backend-backed market reload evidence.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Recovery Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- First Cycle 025 deep smoke failed because the app waited on an unavailable backend request. Added a mobile API timeout and changed the harness to wait for the refreshed Live hierarchy, then reran successfully.

### Cycle 026

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-026
Goal: Extract the featured World Cup futures card into a reusable component without changing the trading flow.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Home now renders the featured futures card through `mobile/src/components/FeaturedFuture.tsx`.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/components/FeaturedFuture.tsx`, `docs/mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-026-holiwyn-search.xml`
- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-026-holiwyn-search-query.xml`
Bugs found:
- An initial attempt to remove the encoded inline card block normalized too much of `App.tsx`; Recovery Harness restored the file and used a safer alias-based extraction.
Technical debt added:
- TD-014: The old inline `FeaturedFuture` function remains in `App.tsx` as dead code until an encoding-safe cleanup cycle removes it.
Technical debt resolved:
- None.
Result: Passed Cycle 026 QA after Recovery Harness. The Home featured card is rendered by the new component and deep smoke still proves ticket, portfolio, live refresh, and search paths.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Extract Holiwyn featured futures card`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 027 should remove the dead inline featured-card function with an encoding-safe patch or continue Home screen decomposition, then write the next heartbeat after merge.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Recovery Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- First edit path created a noisy full-file diff in `App.tsx`; restored the file, rewired the extracted component with a narrow diff, and reran typecheck/deep smoke successfully.

### Cycle 027

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-027
Goal: Remove the stale inline featured futures function after Cycle 026 extraction.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No visual behavior change; Home continues to use `FeaturedFuture.tsx`.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 027

Completed cycles: 025, 026, 027 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Live refresh now calls the shared backend/mock reload path, the featured futures card has a dedicated component, and the stale inline featured-card implementation has been removed.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has deep-smoke coverage for Home, featured future ticket, mock order to Portfolio, Live refresh, Search browse, and typed zero-result Search.
Current backend state: Backend health remains unavailable during emulator smoke, so mock fallback is still the verified path. Mobile API requests now time out quickly instead of hanging.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Deep smoke still depends on coordinate taps; server order mode and real live odds deltas remain unverified; Home screen still has inline SportNav and segmented tabs.
Next three likely cycles: Extract Home support components, add portfolio position detail/P&L, and improve harness taps with selector-based actions.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 036

Completed cycles: 034, 035, 036 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Portfolio positions now expose a close action, deep smoke taps and verifies that close behavior, and bilingual app copy has been extracted into a dedicated localization module.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has verified Home, ticket, mock order, Portfolio summary/detail/close, Live refresh, Search browse, and typed Search zero-result flows on Android emulator.
Current backend state: Backend health remains unavailable during emulator smoke; mock fallback remains verified and mobile API calls are still bounded by timeout.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Close-position automation still uses a coordinate tap; real server order mode, auth-backed positions, live odds deltas, and broader Polymarket sports parity remain unverified.

Technical debt added:
- Activity history is in local app state only; backend persistence should replace it when server-backed portfolios are added.
Technical debt resolved:
- Portfolio now gives users immediate confirmation/history after mock buy and close actions.
Result: Passed Cycle 037 QA. Deep smoke verifies `Recent activity`, `Closed`, and `Bought` after close-position behavior.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn portfolio activity`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.

### Cycle 038

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-038
Goal: Expand World Cup event detail with additional prop/live markets and smoke coverage.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Mexico vs. Ecuador now includes Both teams to score and First goal scorer team prop markets; France vs. Argentina live detail now includes Next goal.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/src/mocks/worldCup.ts`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.
- `npm run smoke:deep` in `mobile/`.

- `docs/mobile/harness/cycle-038-holiwyn-search-query.xml`
Bugs found:
- Initial event-detail assertion expected below-fold props without scrolling; fixed by adding a scrolled prop capture.
- Android Back exits Expo from the state-driven detail view; fixed the harness by relaunching and waiting for Home before continuing trade smoke.
Technical debt added:
- Deep smoke now restarts Expo after event-detail verification, adding runtime but improving reliability.
Technical debt resolved:
- Event-detail grouped market coverage now includes game-line and deeper props, not only the trading ticket path.
Result: Passed Cycle 038 QA. Event detail verifies `Both teams to score` and `First goal scorer team`, then the existing ticket/Portfolio/Live/Search smoke path still passes.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Expand Holiwyn World Cup props`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.
Next cycle: Cycle 039 should continue market parity or improve in-app detail navigation/back behavior.
Harnesses run:
- QA Smoke Harness
- Trading Simulation Harness
- Emulator Runtime Harness
- Screenshot Evidence Harness
- Review Harness
Harness failures:
- First two Cycle 038 smoke attempts exposed harness navigation assumptions; final rerun passed after scroll and relaunch recovery.

### Cycle 039

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-039
Goal: Replace the Event Detail smoke relaunch workaround with real Android Back behavior.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No visual layout changes; Android hardware Back now returns from Event Detail to Home instead of exiting Expo.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:

Bugs found:
- None in final verification.
Technical debt added:
- None.
Technical debt resolved:
- Removed the need for a forced Expo relaunch after Event Detail verification.
- Event Detail now has native Android back behavior aligned with user expectations.
Result: Passed Cycle 039 QA. Deep smoke verifies Event Detail, scrolled props, Android Back return to Home, then ticket/Portfolio/Live/Search flows.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Handle Holiwyn event detail back`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 039

Completed cycles: 037, 038, 039 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Portfolio now shows recent fake-token Bought/Closed activity, Event Detail has richer soccer prop/live markets, and Android hardware Back returns from Event Detail to Home.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has verified Home, Event Detail grouped markets/props, ticket, mock order, Portfolio summary/detail/close/activity, Live refresh, Search browse, and typed Search zero-result flows on Android emulator.
Current backend state: Backend health remains unavailable during emulator smoke; mock fallback remains verified and mobile API calls remain bounded by timeout.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: New activity history is local state only, expanded markets are mock-only, real server order mode and auth-backed positions remain unverified.
Next three likely cycles: Add server-backed order/history adapter seams, expand event-detail trading ergonomics, and improve selector-driven automation for fewer coordinate taps.

### Cycle 040

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-040
Goal: Add a backend Portfolio history adapter seam for server-mode activity.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No visible mock-mode changes; Portfolio activity can now hydrate from backend history when server order mode is enabled.
Backend/API changed: Mobile now targets existing `GET /api/portfolio/history` through `PolyApi.getPortfolioHistory()`.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/api.ts`, `mobile/src/types.ts`, `mobile/src/services/portfolioHistoryService.ts`, `docs/mobile/`.

Bugs found:
- None.
Technical debt added:
- Server-mode history is read-only and only maps resolved backend history; live/open server positions still need a dedicated adapter.
Technical debt resolved:
- Portfolio activity no longer has to remain purely local when server mode is enabled.
Result: Passed Cycle 040 QA. Mock-mode smoke remains unchanged while server-mode activity has a typed backend adapter seam.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn portfolio history adapter`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.

### Cycle 041

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-041
Goal: Add a backend Portfolio snapshot adapter seam for server-mode balance and open positions.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: No visible mock-mode changes; server mode can now hydrate wallet balance and open positions from backend Portfolio data.
Backend/API changed: Mobile now targets existing `GET /api/portfolio` through `PolyApi.getPortfolio()`.

Technical debt added:
- Server-mode position mapping is a first-pass adapter and does not yet display open order rows or combo orders.
Technical debt resolved:
- Server-mode Portfolio can now hydrate wallet balance and open positions through a typed mobile boundary.
Result: Passed Cycle 041 QA. Mock-mode smoke remains unchanged while server-mode Portfolio has a typed snapshot adapter seam.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn portfolio snapshot adapter`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.

### Cycle 042

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-042
Goal: Surface server-mode open orders in Portfolio.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Portfolio can now render an `Open orders` section when server snapshot data includes open orders; mock-mode UI remains unchanged.
Backend/API changed: Reuses existing `GET /api/portfolio` response open-order data through the mobile snapshot adapter.
Database/schema changed: None.

### Heartbeat After Cycle 042

Completed cycles: 040, 041, 042 since the last heartbeat.
Verified progress: Server-mode Portfolio now has typed seams for resolved activity history, wallet/open positions, and open orders, while the mock-mode emulator smoke continues to pass.
Current app state: Holiwyn mobile has verified Home, Event Detail grouped markets/props, ticket, mock order, Portfolio summary/detail/close/activity, Live refresh, Search browse, and typed Search zero-result flows on Android emulator.
Current backend state: Mobile now targets existing backend Portfolio endpoints (`/api/portfolio/history` and `/api/portfolio`) in server mode; backend health remains unavailable during emulator smoke, so mock fallback remains the verified runtime path.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Server-mode Portfolio is typed and wired but not end-to-end verified against an authenticated backend session; open order actions such as cancel/edit are not implemented.
Next three likely cycles: Add open-order cancel/action affordance, add server-mode error/empty states, and improve selector-driven automation for fewer coordinate taps.

### Cycle 043

Date: 2026-07-01
Branch: mobile/cycle-043
Goal: Add a visible Portfolio order confirmation after mock trades.
Reference app screens observed: No new Samsung reference screens.
Holiwyn screens changed: Portfolio now shows a compact `Order placed` confirmation with mode, side, outcome, market, and amount after placing a mock trade.
Backend/API changed: None.
Database/schema changed: None.
Files changed: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/components/Portfolio.tsx`, `mobile/scripts/smoke.ps1`, `docs/mobile/`.
Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/`.

Technical debt added:
- Latest order confirmation is local state only; server-mode order acknowledgement copy should use backend order status when auth trading is active.
Technical debt resolved:
- Users now get an immediate visible confirmation after the mock order transitions into Portfolio.
Result: Passed Cycle 043 QA. Deep smoke verifies `Order placed` after mock order and preserves close-position, activity, Live, and Search flows.
Commit: cycle branch HEAD (`Add Holiwyn order confirmation`)
Merged: Yes, locally merged into `agent/wc-disc-001-discovery-api-audit`.

## Heartbeat Template

### Heartbeat After Cycle 003

Completed cycles: 001, 002, 003.
Verified progress: Repo-local Holiwyn Expo app launches on emulator, dark World Cup shell exists, Games/Futures/Event Detail/Ticket/Portfolio/Search/Live/localization flows work with fake tokens, backend-compatible event adapter is added, and `npm run smoke` can rerun emulator proof.
Current app state: Android-first prototype with mock futures, backend-capable World Cup event hydration, mock order placement, fake 10,000 USDT balance, and English/Simplified Chinese toggle.
Current backend state: Existing backend health is `ok`; event/detail APIs are available and mobile adapter targets `/api/events` plus `/api/events/:slug`. No backend schema changes were made in the first three cycles.
Open blockers: None for autonomous progress.
Risks: Real order placement requires auth/trading guards; large `mobile/App.tsx` will slow future iteration if not split soon; Chinese source text should be normalized if encoding problems appear in editor tooling.
Next three likely cycles: component extraction, order-service boundary with mock/server modes, and richer World Cup market groups/live-state polish.
